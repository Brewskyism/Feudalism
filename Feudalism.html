Women and Parliament in Later Medieval England. By W. Mark Ormrod. London:
Palgrave Macmillan. 2020. xii, 148 pp. £44.99. ISBN 9783030452193.
It is a melancholy task to review a book published only very shortly before the premature
death of its author. Mark Ormrod, it need hardly be said to anyone familiar with latemedieval history, was a scholar of immense distinction, who considerably advanced his
subject not only through his own many publications, most notably his magisterial study of
the reign of Edward III published in 2011, but also in the projects for which he secured
funding, and which he then supervised to completion,most recently ‘England’s Immigrants,
1330–1550’. This short study of women and parliament is on a more modest scale and
written in the face of considerable evidential difficulties. The fact of women’s exclusion
from both parliament as members, and from the franchise as electors, dictates that its focus
must be narrow. Very little can be said beyond what can be inferred from parliamentary
petitions. Their evidence is not only difficult to interpret and unvaried in type, but it is also
not specific to parliament. As Ormrod observes, the pattern of parliamentary petitioning
‘conforms to what is already understood about the occasions and volume of women’s causes’
(p. 11) in other equity jurisdictions, and it is thus legitimate to ask what parliamentary
petitions tell us that is exclusively about women and parliament. To this difficulty is to be
added the lesser one that the nature of parliamentary petitioning changed profoundly over
the late medieval period with a marked decline in both volume and the social range of
petitioners, whether women or men. In the first half of the 14th century female petitioners
included ‘peasant women and … self-declared paupers’ (p. 48); in the 15th, they were more
or less confined to the landed class.
Ormrod has made a sterling effort to overcome these difficulties. He has analysed nearly
8,000 parliamentary petitions. Of these, he finds that some 12% were presented by women,
either in their own right or with others, usually their husbands. The law of coverture
explains, largely at least, why women petitioners were in such a significant minority, for,
in normal circumstances, they joined with their husbands as petitioners only when their
own rights or inheritances were involved. Yet there were occasional instances, coverture
notwithstanding, when the crown answered the petitions presented by married women in
their own names (that is, not joined with their husbands). In these Ormrod sees ‘quite
powerful testimony of women’s agency in parliamentary process’ (p. 48) and a denial of the
notion that ‘patriarchal social convention prevented women – even, sometimes, married
women – from having their say’ (p. 133). It might, however, be objected here that such
petitions were rare and the crown was, in most circumstances, ready to strike them down.
In 1320, to cite a notable example, a petition of Blanche, Lady Wake, was rejected on the
grounds that, as a married woman, she had no right to have an action in her own name, even
though she was seeking protection for her husband’s rights in his absence on pilgrimage.

Generally speaking, it was only as femmes soles that women had the opportunity to petition
in their own exclusive right, and it is in these petitions that it is easier to see evidence of
female agency. Ormrod goes so far as to argue that they show that women saw parliament
as a forum in which ‘the interests of their gender might be advanced’ (p. 7). Yet he is too
measured a scholar to press the point too far, and he does not disguise the difficulties in
determining ‘agency’ in the face of the discouraging indications that things are sometimes
not as they appear. On the face of it, petitions in the name of a group of women, such as
the famous petitions presented by the silkwomen of London between 1455 and 1504, are
the clearest indication of female initiative in the quest for redress or concessions from the
crown. Yet not only are such examples very few, but those there are have to be interpreted
with caution.Ormrod cites the striking example of a petition of 1394,ostensibly a collective
one presented by the ‘widows of London’, but probably drawn up by the city’s clerics in a
common action against a levy imposed by the civic authorities.
In drawing general conclusions, the ambiguities and limitations of the evidence justify
Ormrod in taking rather contrasting positions. He describes the parliamentary trial of Edward III’s mistress, Alice Perrers, as evidence of a ‘deeply misogynistic’ political culture’
(p. 53), interpreting it not as a legitimate response to the many allegations of maintenance
made against her, but rather as a manifestation of hostility to a woman ‘who dared to challenge the patriarchy by acting independently of male authority’ (p.53).Yet overall he takes a
more sympathetic view, portraying a culture, or at least a parliamentary one, that was much
less overtly misogynistic. In line with Goldberg’s conclusions concerning the church courts,
he finds no ‘particular suggestion that women were systematically disadvantaged’ in the petitioning process’ (p. 128); in the emotive language used by the Commons when they took
up private petitions from women alleging rape, he discerns an ‘emotional reaction quite
beyond the ordinary rhetoric of politics’ (p. 103); and in the promotion of the petitions of
wives who had lost their right to dower through the condemnation of their husbands for
treason, he sees a parliamentary willingness to ameliorate the harshness of the common law
in the female interest. Another consideration might be added to this side of the balance,
although one not argued by Ormrod: the virtual immunity of women from parliamentary
attainder. Such inferences can only be tentative, not least because it is often impossible to
discern the real voice behind any petition or to chart the course by which it made its way
through parliament, but this book provides a stimulating framework for future debate.

Bastard Feudalism, English Society and the Law: The Statutes of Livery, 1390–1520.
By Gordon McKelvie. Woodbridge: The Boydell Press. 2020. xii, 249 pp. £60.00.
ISBN 9781783274772.
Since the 1940s, when K.B. McFarlane appropriated the term from Victorian Whig historians, there has been much discussion of ‘bastard feudalism’.1 Its usefulness as a term,
relevance to modern historiography, and precise definition has been debated at length for

decades.2 Yet, as Gordon McKelvie states in the first paragraph of his book, the term is a
useful shorthand to describe the ‘socio-political relations that were most prominent during
the late medieval period’ (p. 1). It is one of the few quantifiable aspects of this system, the
distribution of liveries,that this book looks at in detail, specifically the recorded instances of
the illegal giving and receiving of livery. Through analysis of the legislation regulating liveries, and the indictments brought upon this legislation, Dr McKelvie aims to demonstrate
not only how pervasive retaining was in later-medieval England, but also how important
‘bastard feudalism’was in ‘understanding the nature of law, politics and society’in the period
(p. 11).
The first part of the book analyses the political events preceding the enactment of the
statutes of livery; a timeline of parliamentary activity makes clear the key points of legislative
development (pp. x–xii). Despite concerns about the (mis)use of liveries, it was not feasible
to simply remove the system outright, so ingrained was the practice in English society at
this time. Instead, legislation was needed to keep the system in check (pp. 31–2). Chapters
2 and 3 describe the parliamentary complaints that resulted in such regulations. Initially,
these were only sporadically enforced; grievances were not yet large or widespread enough
to prompt their consistent implementation (p. 56).The violent upheavals of the Wars of the
Roses – when noble affinities could pose a real threat to the king – provided the catalyst
for new statutes of livery and real efforts to have them enforced. This period, and Henry
VII’s attempts to bring the nobility and gentry back in line following that bloody conflict,
form the focus of the third chapter.
The second part of the book looks in more detail at indictments for the illegal distribution
of liveries during the period. Chapter 4 describes the various outcomes of these cases,
defendants procuring pardons, evading sheriffs’ writs, and being subject to fines and bonds.
Royal interventions, which halted legal proceedings in such matters, are also considered.
Chapters 5 and 6 provide analyses of McKelvie’s dataset of 336 cases of illegal livery and
retaining, drawn from the crown side of king’s bench for the period 1390 to 1522. Chapter
5 describes the identity of the indicted. Though the peerage is considered in this chapter,
examples of indictments involving the gentry (and peasants), clergy, women, and townsmen
demonstrate that the construction of affinities was not solely the preserve of the secular male
peerage (p. 130). Chapter 6 looks in more detail at where each of these cases occurred.
The remaining three chapters look more broadly at aspects of ‘bastard feudal’ society,
and how the giving of (illegal) livery connects to these. Chapter 7 examines how retaining
relationships were forged.Again,McKelvie’s study differs from previous work by looking at
the retaining practices of those outside of the male peerage, to show how landholding and
familial connections created relationships further down the social strata.Chapter 8 addresses
the connection between livery and disorder, a key point of concern for late medieval kings.
Finally, chapter 9 assesses how affinities were forged in urban communities and how royals
attempted to enforce livery legislation in these areas. Drawing together his findings, McKelvie’s study concludes in the 1520s, after which cases of illegal livery became less prevalent
in the records of king’s bench.
Five appendices list the number of cases by reign and in each county, letters to towns
and lordships, local ordinances, and letters from Henry VII to duchy of Lancaster officials.
Though they make clear some of the arguments and analyses put forward earlier in the
book, they would perhaps have been better served in the chapters to which they refer.
Instead,this reviewer would have preferred to see the 336 cases of illegal livery, which form

the core dataset of this study, tabulated together. A complete search of over a century of
controlment rolls is no mean feat and it would have been nice to see these data collected
somewhere in this book.
Concerning this core dataset, this reviewer has one minor quibble. Though the records
of the crown side of king’s bench (and the equivalent palatinate courts) are thoroughly
consulted in this work, other records containing instances of illegal livery, such as those
for the plea side of king’s bench or the court of common pleas, are used sparingly. The
reason given for this is that these cases were rarer and so are only referred to when they
illuminate wider points (p. 9). Though that may be true, private actions of illegal livery
would no doubt further highlight how the statutes of livery were used by the lower echelons
of society, outside of the male peerage. Additionally, although aspects of the law have been
considered in this study,there is little in terms of legal opinion.The printed Year Books,now
searchable online, contain some interesting legal discussions about livery and maintenance,
which would have augmented this book’s conclusions on the application of the legislation.3
In particular, a lengthy discussion in 1490 of the various statutes of liveries provides a
contemporary record of how each statute was viewed by those presiding over illegal livery
cases.4
Overall, McKelvie is to be commended for drawing out evidence from a complex set of
legal records which informs our understanding of ‘bastard feudalism’ in the later medieval
period.The existence of this book is proof that even on a topic as widely discussed as ‘bastard
feudalism’, approaches which utilise the vast collections of surviving original records can
often find new things to say.

A Primrose Path: The Gilded Life of Lord Rosebery’s Favourite Son. By Martin Gibson.
London: Arum Press. 2020. xiv, 273 pp. £20.00. ISBN 9781916265400.
This book’s subject is Neil Primrose (1882–1917), Liberal MP for Wisbech January 1910–
17 and younger son of Archibald Primrose,5th earl of Rosebery and Liberal prime minister
1894–5. The author, Martin Gibson, became interested in Primrose while living near Wisbech and was surprised to see so little information publicly available on the area’s former
MP. His book is the result of a great deal of painstaking research that has included the
discovery of Primrose’s hitherto unknown political and financial papers in the Waddesdon
Archive. Gibson’s narrative of Primrose’s life contains much new information about its subject’s short political career and has benefited from being edited by Cameron Hazlehurst,the
distinguished historian of early 20th-century politics.

A Primrose Path is therefore a welcome addition to the limited collection of studies of
Liberal MPs from the first two decades of the 20th century. While a great deal has been
written about leading figures, such as Asquith, Lloyd George and Churchill, much less is
known about the backbenchers and junior office holders who constituted the rank and
file in the house of commons and whose support was crucial to sustaining the Liberal
governments of 1905–15 and to the party’s campaigning and organisation in the localities.
Primrose was in some ways an unusual figure in this group. Most of the party’s supporters
among great landowners and peers had deserted liberalism over Irish home rule in the mid
1880s and many of the remainder left the party following Lloyd George’s ‘People’s Budget’
of 1909 – including Primrose’s father. But while Liberals may have increasingly disliked
landowners as a class, they remained susceptible to the appeal of individual landowners
who retained their Liberal faith, especially if, like Primrose,they could boast a distinguished
Liberal past in their family. Moreover, Liberal landowners who wanted to enter politics
could usually count on an early and well-connected entrée that ensured them a head start
over their rivals. There were still six members of this class in the cabinet when the Liberal
government was replaced by a coalition in May 1915.
Gibson’s book provides an interesting case study of how new Liberal MPs were recruited
into government office.Like most other MPs seeking advancement,Primrose brought himself to the notice of the whips and the prime minister both by making trouble, as,for example when he protested about changes to the coronation oath in 1911 and the lack of Liberal
JPs in his constituency, and by proving himself useful to the party, notably as treasurer of the
committee set up in 1912 to promote its national insurance legislation.However, Primrose’s
background, wealth and connections provided him with advantages that other aspirants for
office did not possess. He became candidate for Wisbech in 1908 aged only 25 years, and
after his election his claims to office were pushed at different points by Winston Churchill,
Sir Edward Grey and the marquess of Crewe (Primrose’s brother-in-law), all of whom were
cabinet ministers from a landed background. It is perhaps rather surprising that Primrose
did not obtain his first post, as undersecretary at the foreign office, until February 1915.
However, Gibson’s book, despite its detail, also reveals how much about the Edwardian
high political world remains rather mysterious. Primrose was naturally seen as a proponent of the Liberal imperialist strand of thought in the party associated with Rosebery’s
name. After 1910 Liberal imperialists were no longer grouped in a formal organisation, but
many Liberal MPs and cabinet ministers still espoused Liberal imperialist ideas, especially by
favouring increased expenditure on the navy and a robust foreign and imperial policy,while
being cautious (or covertly opposed to) Irish home rule.At first Primrose followed this line,
causing some controversy by seeming to oppose home rule outright in the December 1910
election. However, by the summer of 1914 Primrose had performed a complete volte-face
and had become one of home rule’s leading advocates, opposing concessions to Ulster and
insisting Sir Edward Carson, the unionist leader, should be arrested for the violence of his
speeches. Gibson suggests that thwarted ambition may have led Primrose in this direction
and this is certainly possible.
The same motive may also have lain behind the unexpected new links Primrose started
to develop around this time with Lloyd George and one of the Welshman’s acolytes,the MP
and owner of the Sunday paper, Reynolds’s Newspaper, Sir J.H. Dalziel (who was left £200
in Primrose’s will). By February 1915 Asquith was surprised to find Lloyd George urging
him to appoint Primrose to office. The prime minister finally agreed, only for Primrose to

be displaced when the coalition was formed in May 1915. By this time the First World War
was underway and Primrose, who had been a territorial army officer since 1909, returned
to military duties in the near east. He did not gain office again until he became military
secretary to the ministry of munitions in September 1916. It is conceivable that Primrose
played a minor role in the displacement of Asquith by Lloyd George in December 1916
– he was present at J.H. Dalziel’s house the day before Reynolds’s Newspaper leaked news
of the crisis on 3 December. He was certainly considered by Lloyd George for the job
of minister of labour before reluctantly agreeing to be chief whip, on a temporary basis.
Primrose heartily disliked the selling of titles to raise party funds that was part of this role
and insisted on returning to active service,where he was killed in Palestine on 15 November
1917.His death was much-mourned and cut short a political career that had only just begun
to take flight. Gibson’s book serves as a fitting tribute to Primrose’s life as well as throwing
some new light on one of the many obscure corners of early 20th-century liberalism.

The Political Lives of Postwar British MPs: An Oral History of Parliament. Edited by
Emma Peplow and Priscila Pivatto. London: Bloomsbury. 2020. x, 273 pp. £85.00.
ISBN 9781350089266.
In 2011 the History of Parliament Trust began an ambitious oral history project to record
the spoken testimony – or ‘life stories’ – of former members of parliament. The project
is ongoing, and the recorded interviews explore every aspect of a politician’s life, from
their upbringing and childhood through to their education, careers and post-parliamentary
activities. The recordings have formed a major new sound archive at the British Library
comprising over 175 in-depth interviews (and counting). Edited by Emma Peplow and
Priscila Pivatto, who have co-ordinated the oral history project since its inception, The
Political Lives of Postwar British MPs is the first major publication based on these recordings.
Each chapter in this volume is composed entirely of excerpts taken from the interviews and
is ‘intended largely as an introduction’ (p. 1) to the archive. To this end each excerpt has an
endnote identifying the interview’s British Library reference number and a full ‘Glossary of
MPs’ lists all the interviews currently in the archive. A comprehensive index further helps
direct readers to specific topics of interest in the book and will be helpful to researchers
seeking those topics within the archive itself.
The Political Lives of Postwar British MPs does more than introduce readers to the new
archive, however. By publishing excerpts from the interviews it provides a new resource for
researchers in its own right, contextualising the recordings both in comparison with other
voices in the archive and within the wider historical setting. Peplow and Pivatto have made
a careful selection from ‘the hundreds of hours of recording’ (p. 1) and have juxtaposed the
extracts in order to build a rich picture of British parliamentary life. Sadly we do not hear
the voices of prime ministers or opposition leaders, but with those exceptions, the voices
of all types of politician – from all parties and from all levels of government – are recorded

here; some are well-known names, others less so, but all contribute new insights. Indeed,
in covering such a range of individual experience this book will not only be of interest to
modern historians and political scientists but will make useful reading for aspiring politicians
and special advisors in search of advice.
Excluding the introduction and conclusion the book comprises 15 chapters divided into
five thematic ‘parts’: ‘Background’; ‘Politics before Westminster’; ‘House of Commons’;
‘Politics’; and ‘Reflections’. Each chapter begins with a short introduction by Peplow and
Pivatto positioning the excerpts in relation to the chapter’s given theme, highlighting the
common and contrasting experiences of the politicians that are quoted. Part I examines
the background of the interviewees with chapters 1 and 2 sharing personal descriptions
of the interviewees’ formative years: their upbringing, home life, education, early careers,
and the cultural, economic and social forces that helped shape their political outlook. Part
II explores the interviewees’ engagement in politics before Westminster with chapters 3, 4
and 5, exploring how the MPs first engaged with politics seriously, why they chose their
party, and the route they took to professional political life in Westminster. There is a range
of experience represented here, but most of the MPs quoted grew up in politically engaged
households with parents who were actively involved in politics (as MPs, councillors, election agents, or union shop stewards). The power and personalities of constituency parties,
selection committees, election agents and local activists are also vividly described in these
chapters along with the tactics, travails, delights and devastations of electioneering.
Having been elected, Part III brings us personal accounts of day-to-day life within
Westminster: including first impressions of the houses of parliament, descriptions of its
culture and facilities, the protocols of the Commons’ chamber and committee rooms, and
the alliances forged (and gossip shared) in its bars, tea room, dining rooms and library.
Most newcomers expressed surprise that there was no formal induction and, prior to
the construction of Portcullis House, MPs found the office space inadequate. As Ann
Widdecombe recalled: ‘there was no induction programme … nobody met you, nobody
was showing you around … It was bewildering, in those days you didn’t have a desk, you
just did your work in the corridors’ (p. 87).
Following the unusual working patterns of parliament, the final chapter of Part III, entitled ‘Gender matters’,focuses on the specific experiences of women in what was considered
the ‘overwhelmingly masculine’ environment of Westminster (p. 105). Tellingly, while all
the female interviewees discussed issues associated with gender, very few men did, with
many female MPs recounting their shock at experiencing both direct and indirect sexism
in parliament. Alongside accounts of casual sexism, the quality and availability of amenities
for women in Westminster and the adoption, by the Labour Party, of all-women shortlists
in 1997 are discussed. With an ever-growing number of women taking seats in parliament
these, often unheard, accounts are significant and should have the potential not only to inform our historical analysis but to influence the way the Palace of Westminster is currently
set up and organised.
Part IV focuses on the activity of doing politics: maintaining party discipline and cohesion, passing legislation, reacting to events and representing the constituency. Chapter
9 explores the mechanics of party politics. Interviewees describe their experiences of the
whipping system and how the mechanisms for maintaining party discipline could cause
them major political dilemmas. Chapters 10 and 11 see the MPs comment on the passage
of legislation and reminisce about specific events and the strategies they adopted to effect

change from the backbenches. Here the interviewees give first-hand accounts of some of
the most momentous – and divisive – political events of the last 50 years from the Suez
Crisis to the invasion of Iraq in 2001.Many of the issues discussed remain contentious today.
The excerpts include new political memories of the Troubles, the rise and fall of Margaret
Thatcher, the Falklands War, the Maastricht treaty and Britain’s relationship with Europe
more broadly.
Chapter 12 returns to the constituency with a focus on how the MPs nurtured, maintained and, sometimes, lost the confidence of their constituency parties and electorates.
We hear first-hand accounts of constituency surgeries, the contrasting priorities of constituency casework and Westminster, and the myriad issues that exercised constituents as
well as the entryist tactics of Militant Tendency. To some – especially those representing
marginal seats – the constituency was the ‘number one [priority]’ (p. 169), while others
focused on Westminster and refused to do ‘the job of a local councillor’ (p. 166).
Finally, Part V hears the interviewees reflect on their careers as a whole. Chapters 13,
14 and 15 provide testimony on career highlights and regrets, the impact of a political
career on family life, and how it felt finally to leave the house of commons. Through these,
often candid, chapters we learn of the pride and personal achievement the politicians felt in
becoming MPs and in the work they did. All came to the House with ambitions to effect
positive change but many,especially on the backbenches,found this difficult and unfulfilling.
With its large workload and long hours, most of the MPs regretted that a career in politics
‘didn’t fit very well’ (p. 192) with having a family. Many felt similar to Dick Taverne who
summed up that:‘you are terribly busy,you achieve very little and you have very little family
life’ (p. 187). Yet despite these widespread misgivings, when it came to leaving Westminster
– particularly after an electoral defeat – most MPs felt a sense of shock and loss which was
described often as ‘a bit like a bereavement’ (p. 204). They missed the prestige, the work,
and the sense of being ‘at the centre of things’ (p. 211). Future employment prospects were
a concern for some, while for others there was the possibility of a seat in the Lords or the
welcome relief at leaving behind the heavy responsibilities of parliament.
Much oral history in the United Kingdom evolved as a methodology for constructing a
‘history from below’ and has tended to focus on the ‘unheard narratives’ of those traditionally excluded from the historical record. As one of the most privileged, documented and
recorded groups in our society some may question the need to record the ‘life story’ narratives of MPs. Yet, while MPs are widely recorded in the media and in Hansard, the type of
oral testimony found in this book (and associated archive) has generally gone unrecorded.
It is often more open, candid, personal, and illuminating than anything found in the official
public record and offers fresh new perspectives. It is for these reasons that oral history has
increased in popularity as a methodology for studying modern political institutions and
The Political Lives of Postwar British MPs is but the most recent of a number of publications
that uses oral history to tell the story of particular parliaments or administrations. (See for
instance Russell L.Riley’s Inside the Clinton White House (2016) and Thomas A.W. Stewart’s
The Scottish Parliament in its Own Words (2019). Since 1976 the United States Senate Historical Office has also conducted oral history interviews with former senators and retired
members of the Senate staff.)
Certainly, as with all forms of historical evidence,oral history has its limitations.Concerns
– common to all oral history – might include issues surrounding an interviewee’s memory,
their subjectivity, and how far we can trust their recollections in light of their interests in

‘legacy building’ and presenting themselves in the best light. For example, many MPs noted
the ‘drinks culture’ (p. 91) of parliament but few admitted to drinking or ever getting
drunk themselves. Peplow and Pivatto are alert to these problems and acknowledge that
‘the interviews are never going to present the entire truth about the careers, decisions and
experiences of our interviewees’ (p. 5). Their approach, rather, is ‘to probe for detail and
understand the motivations and actions of the interviewee’ (p. 5). The interviews excerpted
in this book may not represent an objective ‘truth’ (if that is ever possible to achieve) but by
presenting multiple perspectives alongside each other Peplow and Pivatto have succeeded in
giving us a unique,collective impression into how British politicians understood themselves
and their work in the mid to late 20th century.
While MPs may be some of the most recorded people in British society, they are often
criticised in the popular media as calculating, self-serving, and ‘out of touch’. The interviews extracted in The Political Lives of Postwar British MPs are a welcome antidote to this
popular scepticism. While we must be wise to their bias, here MPs emerge as ‘real’ people
from a range of backgrounds who candidly share their individual experiences, motivations,
successes and regrets. The interviews vividly bring to life the human drama lived by those
working at the heart of Britain’s democracy. While sceptics might question some of the
memories, and how the MPs chose to represent themselves, it would be difficult to dismiss
entirely the clear collective commitment and pride the MPs display in serving their country
and constituents as members of parliament.

Abstract
Regulators and other governors rely on intermediaries to set and implement policies and to regulate targets. Existing literatures focus heavily on intermediaries of a single type – Opportunists, motivated solely by self-interest. But intermediaries can
also be motivated by different types of loyalty: to leaders (Vassals), to policies (Zealots), or to institutions (Mandarins). While
all three types of loyalists are resistant to the traditional problems of opportunism (slacking and capture), each brings pathologies of its own. We explain the behavioral logic of each type of loyalty and analyze the risks and rewards of different intermediary loyalties – both for governors and for the public interest. We illustrate our claims with examples drawn from many
different realms of regulation and governance.

1. Introduction: Intermediaries, opportunism, and loyalty
All governors rely on intermediaries to govern but are wary of their autonomy. This is why governors often have
a strong preference for loyal intermediaries. The quotation from Lyndon Johnson provides a characteristically
graphic example; Donald Trump similarly said: “I value loyalty above everything else – more than brains, more
than drive and more than energy” (Trump & Zanker 2007, p. 160).
There are good reasons for governors to seek loyalty. While intermediaries may extend a governor’s reach
and contribute important competencies, all intermediaries possess some degree of autonomy. The literature on
indirect governance, from principal-agent (PA) theory to the study of regulatory intermediaries (RI), frequently
assumes that governance intermediaries will exercise their autonomy opportunistically, to the extent possible, furthering their own self-interest, not the interests of the governor or the broader public.2 Intermediaries “slack,”
exerting less effort than contracted; they “slip,” promoting their own status, power, and income; they allow

themselves to be “captured” by the governor’s targets or rivals; and when it serves their purposes, they deceive,
confuse or betray the governor.
Intermediary loyalty promises governors some relief from the problems of opportunism. Loyalty is a “special
attachment” (Hirschman 1970, p. 77) to an external object of loyalty (e.g. a person, policy, or institution) that displaces the loyalist’s devotion to self-interest. A loyal intermediary will not slack, slip, or submit to capture if this
harms the object of its loyalty. Loyal self-restraint can thus make intermediary autonomy less threatening to a
governor – so long as intermediaries’ loyalties coincide with the governor’s interests or goals, as where intermediaries are loyal to the governor itself or to objects of loyalty consistent with its goals.3 For these reasons, governors
are often aggressive in seeking loyalty: James Comey (2018, pp. 237–238), former FBI Director, describes President Trump’s face-to-face demand for personal loyalty as resembling “Sammy the Bull’s Cosa Nostra induction
ceremony.”
Similarly, loyalties that are consistent with effective, responsive, and legitimate governance can promote the
public interest.4 For example, the German Chancellor Bismarck enjoyed broad autonomy from Emperor
Wilhelm. He did not simply execute the Emperor’s instructions, but autonomously made his own policies, which
often ran counter to Wilhelm’s instincts. Wilhelm even complained that it was “hard to be Emperor under such
a Chancellor.” But Bismarck did not abuse his autonomy to pursue his own self-interest; rather, his loyalties were
to Wilhelm and to Prussia (von Krockow 1997).
Yet loyalty is a mixed blessing: while it mitigates self-seeking, it can create new problems, especially when
intermediary loyalty does not coincide with the interests of the governor or the public. For example, Talleyrand
faithfully served Napoleon, inter alia as Foreign Minister, for almost a decade. However, when Napoleon began
to wage wars of choice that endangered France’s hegemony in Europe and its domestic stability, Talleyrand clandestinely supported the Bourbon restoration plotting against him. Here too, Talleyrand was not pursuing his own
self-interest (indeed, he sacrificed his position under Napoleon), but rather his loyalty to France, which came to
diverge from Napoleon’s interests (Willms 2005). Moreover, as Talleyrand’s plotting nicely exemplifies, intermediary loyalty does not necessarily mitigate problems of guile and cunning.
In this paper, we theorize the behavior of loyal intermediaries, in contrast to that of opportunists, and the
consequences of their actions for governors and the public interest. In the following sections, we ask three broad
questions: How do governance intermediaries exercise their autonomy? When will their choices benefit or harm
their governor? And when will they serve or undercut the public interest? These are important questions not only
for high-level intermediaries such as Bismarck and Talleyrand, but also for operating-level intermediaries, from
executive branch bureaucracies and independent regulatory agencies to intelligence agencies, central banks, and
international organizations.
In response to the first question (Section 2 below), we draw on a wide range of empirical examples and literatures to distinguish three loyalist ideal types: Vassals, loyal to particular persons; Zealots, loyal to specific policies
or principles; and Mandarins, loyal to particular institutions and their rules, procedures, and ethos. All three
forms of loyalty engage actors’ emotions and identity, and follow a logic of appropriateness. We treat Opportunists as a theoretical baseline against which to contrast loyal behavior.
In response to the second question (Section 3), we discuss the behavioral logics that follow from the motivations characterizing each ideal type, and the policy benefits and control problems these create for governors. Different forms of loyalty enable intermediaries to faithfully perform specific governance functions, such as
enhancing the credibility of commitments. Yet each type of loyalty also carries its own pathology, despite seeming
coincidence with the governor’s goals: Vassals may over-comply, following or anticipating their governors’ wishes
even if doing so is ultimately self-defeating; Zealots may over-commit to their favored policies, refusing to balance
competing considerations that their governors favor; and Mandarins may be over-conservative, insisting on
established institutional practices even when the governor seeks flexibility.
To address the third question (Section 4), we explore the implications of intermediary types for the public
interest – understood as both enabling effective governance where the governor’s interests align with the
public interest, and constraining the governor’s authority where those interests diverge. Vassals’ personal loyalty
can make a governor more effective, but can also shield it from public accountability and undercut checks and
balances designed to prevent authoritarian rule. Zealots’ commitment to specific policies can motivate them to
acquire relevant expertise, but risks skewing public policy in extreme, absolutist directions. Finally, Mandarins’

devotion to institutional traditions can check the governor’s power, but can also lead to excessive bureaucratization and red tape.
Section 5 concludes by emphasizing the pervasive and diverse institutional design issues involved in enabling
effective governance through loyalist and opportunistic intermediaries, and in ensuring that those intermediaries serve
the public interest. In the light of intermediary loyalty, understanding how governors and intermediaries behave, and
how rules, institutions, and practices shape the processes by which intermediaries are developed, selected, assigned
roles, managed, and protected from political interference, are central to good governance. In addition to their importance for regulatory policy, these mechanisms are central to constraining excessive accumulations of authority and
defending democracy from illiberal forces.
2. Intermediaries: Four ideal types
Governors enlist intermediaries to address the targets of regulation and governance in ways that governors themselves cannot.5 More specifically, governors enlist intermediaries to extend their own reach and to gain governance competencies they lack, such as policy expertise, operational capacity, legitimacy, and credibility to third
parties. Whatever the control regime in which they operate – delegation, orchestration, cooptation, or trusteeship
– the competencies intermediaries contribute guarantee them some degree of autonomy from the governor’s control; the more the governor depends on those competencies, the more autonomy intermediaries enjoy (Abbott
et al. 2020). Information asymmetry further enhances autonomy: governor control is inevitably limited by the
governor’s lack of perfect information on its intermediaries’ motivations and activities. And, in general, it is
“costly and may be impossible to design a system of supervision with rewards and punishment such that everyone has the incentive to exert himself” (Sen 1977, p. 334).
How do intermediaries exercise their autonomy?6 The PA and RI literatures frequently assume that intermediaries are Opportunists.
7 Opportunists are egoistic: self-seeking, loyal only to self.8 They act exclusively to further
their own interests, such as their income, status, and leisure, without regard for the effects of their actions on
others. The characteristic problems they create, in these literatures, are self-interested shirking, slippage, and capture. Moreover, Opportunists are “self-interest seeking with guile,” in Williamson’s (1975, p. 255) famous phrase;
they exploit their autonomy “to mislead, distort, disguise, obfuscate, or otherwise confuse” the governor.
This is, however, “a remarkably thin view of [intermediary] behavior” (Hawkins & Jacoby 2006, p. 199).
Intermediaries may have motivations other than pure self-interest, and those motivations will produce different
behavioral logics, with different implications for governors and the public interest, for the success or failure of
regulation and governance. The study of indirect governance must take such variations seriously.
More specifically, we argue that many governance intermediaries are motivated by different forms of loyalty,
not (only) by self-interest. We do not claim that these forms exhaust the possible variations among intermediary
motivations, but we do claim that they are particularly important to regulation and governance.
Loyalists are driven by allegiance or devotion to an object of loyalty other than self. Allegiance or devotion is
not motivated by self-interest: Don Sutton, the Hall of Fame baseball pitcher, famously said “I’m the most loyal
player money can buy,”
9 but that is not true loyalty, as Sutton clearly understood. True allegiance or devotion –
what Sen (1977, pp. 326–329) calls “commitment” – “drives a wedge between personal choice and personal
welfare,” leading actors to choose certain actions even if doing so reduces their own personal benefits.
We distinguish three distinct objects of loyalty – to a person, a policy, or an institution – drawing on examples from diverse historical periods and literatures ranging from public administration and regulatory governance
to the study of party loyalty, international civil servants, authoritarian regimes, criminal and terrorist organizations, and the “deep state.”
10 We identify three ideal types of loyalist intermediaries – Vassals, Zealots, and Mandarins – each corresponding to a different object of loyalty. In its pure ideal type, each category of loyalist owes
complete allegiance to only one object of loyalty.11
Vassals are intermediaries loyal only to a specific person or group.12 Here we treat Vassals as loyal to the person of the governor, be that an individual – such as a president, a party leader, or the head of a regulatory agency
(Egorov & Sonin 2011) – or a group, such as the Politburo, the cabinet, or a ruling junta (Hildreth et al. 2016).13

godfather to officials devoted to a charismatic leader. In much political discourse, as in the statements of Presidents Johnson and Trump quoted earlier, “loyalty” refers only to this type.
Zealots are intermediaries loyal only to a specific policy, principle, or ideology.14 Examples include NGO
activists committed to human rights, economists committed to neo-liberal policy prescriptions, environmentalists
committed to combatting climate change, and Marxist revolutionaries committed to a Communist utopia.15
Mandarins are intermediaries loyal only to a specific institution, such as the Department of Justice or the
European Court of Justice. That includes the ethos, traditions, and protocols of the institution, including its rules,
procedures, and practices.16 Loyalty is to the institution itself, not to its incumbent leaders: for example, to the
presidency, not the sitting president; to the regulatory agency, not its director. Here we treat Mandarins as loyal
to the institution for which they act.
Table 1 summarizes these four intermediary types, defined by the distinct interests or loyalties that motivate
their actions.
Importantly, while their motivations vary, all four types – not only Opportunists – act rationally and strategically. Thus, for example, a Zealot may strategically accept weaker action on a favored policy in the short run if it
calculates that doing so will contribute to stronger action in the long run. In addition, like Talleyrand and Bismarck – not to mention Mafiosi and Marxist revolutionaries – intermediaries may act with guile and cunning
whether they are driven by self-interest or by loyalty. Finally, in all four ideal types, intermediaries use other elements of their social environment – including other persons, policies, and institutions – instrumentally, in line
with their motivations. Thus, all four types may disregard the effects of their actions on other interests, persons,
policies, or institutions, and may utilize, betray, or sacrifice other interests, persons, policies, or institutions where
this furthers their own singular ends.
While self-interest and the three forms of loyalty share important common features, including strategic rationality and instrumental behavior, loyalty differs from self-interest in other ways, giving loyalists special characteristics not shared by Opportunists. Pure loyalty stems from a “sense of obligation;” actors are loyal “because it is
the right thing to do” (Fletcher 1995; Kleinig 2014; Hildreth et al. 2016). In other words, the relationship between
a loyalist and the object of its loyalty follows a logic of appropriateness (March & Olsen 1998), not (as with Sutton and other Opportunists) a logic of consequences.17 The loyalist’s attachment to its object often has a strong
emotional component (Connor 2007; Kleinig 2014); it “is deeply affective and not primarily rational”
(Shklar 1993, p. 184). The attachment expresses social status and belonging, constituting, certifying, and signaling
actors’ identities and self-conceptions – who they are, or at least who they aspire to be (Connor 2007, p. 49;
Newson et al. 2016).
The nature of loyalist attachments has three implications for behavior, all of which stem from the commitment to an external object and the logic of appropriateness that characterize loyalty.
• First, the logic of appropriateness means that pure loyalists will remain faithful to the object of their loyalty
in the face of competing considerations, including self-interest. In extreme cases – for example, Mafia
members, committed revolutionaries, suicide bombers, and Secret Service agents – loyalists even sacrifice
their lives.
• Second, the logic of appropriateness makes loyalists relatively inflexible. In particular, while loyalists may
make compromises for strategic reasons, they strongly resist tradeoffs with other objects, including selfinterest: for example, a Vassal will not sacrifice the governor’s personal interests for policy gains; a Zealot
will not sacrifice policy gains for personal side-payments; and a Mandarin will not harm its institution to
please the governor.18

• Third, their grounding in identity, emotional attachment, and a logic of appropriateness renders loyalties
highly stable. This makes them easier to assess than goals, interests, or preferences, which tend to be more
fluid.19 To be sure, exogenous changes in social context or endogenous changes of character can trigger
shifts in or losses of loyalty, but giving up an established loyalty is always a wrenching decision. A significant shock is necessary, and even then loyalty may persist for a considerable time.
How do actors acquire loyalty? We can only suggest some relevant processes here.20 Some loyalists are “born”:
their families have traditional attachments to a person (the Mafia don), policy (civil rights), or institution (police,
military, civil service). Charismatic persons (Mao, Trump) and institutions (FBI, Green Berets) attract loyalty.
Educational programs frequently instill seeds of loyalty or strengthen nascent loyalties. Close association with loyalists can socialize actors into loyalties. Loyalty may also be shaped by broader forces, including religion and culture, socially constructed and sometimes deliberately inculcated through education or indoctrination, as in the
Chinese Cultural Revolution (Sen 1977, p. 334). While loyalties (like goals, interests, and preferences) cannot be
observed directly, intermediaries’ prior involvement in processes such as these can “reveal” the presence of particular forms of loyalty. These processes can also modify or destroy loyalty, but not easily or quickly.
Finally, actors may initially enter a relationship out of self-interest – “hitching their wagon to a star” who
promises status or riches, to an institution that promises power or security, or to a policy position that promises
advancement – but develop loyalty over time (Zakharov 2016). Actors may develop true loyalty through socialization or habituation, or may simply become so deeply dependent on a person, policy, or institution that they must
continue to behave loyally.
Actors may, of course, disguise their true commitments, initially or throughout the relationship. Governors
employ a variety of techniques – from investigating past behavior and associations, to requiring training and
socialization programs, to demanding costly signals of loyalty – to identify and shape intermediaries’ commitments. This last point is especially salient: Chinese leaders require officials to demonstrate loyalty through public
“groveling” (Shih 2008), while in the Mafia and terrorist groups, “to prove their allegiance members … are often
required to kill, kidnap or rob” someone (Crenshaw 1986). Such actions also buttress loyalty with self-interest,
making continued loyalty – or as-if-loyal behavior – essential by foreclosing outside options or creating risks of
punishment.
Loyalty can be an attribute of individuals or collectives. While we emphasize individuals – and the allegiance
of Vassals, Zealots, and Mandarins is easiest to understand at that level – organizations can also exhibit loyalty,
just as it sometimes is useful to talk about “organizational interests.” Social movements and advocacy NGOs
cohere around principles and policies; government auditors, inspectors general, and tax administrations dedicate
themselves to rule compliance; Marxist, Leninist, Stalinist, and Maoist parties take on the name and identity of
their leaders (Michels 1910 1999, p. 93). In all these cases, an organization with a strong and homogeneous culture of loyalty can itself usefully be characterized as a loyalist of a particular type.21 The loyalty of the group and
its members – as well as organizational norms and rules – then reinforces individual loyalty.
An organizational culture of loyalty can evolve over time through the self-reinforcing effects of individual
actions, or it can be instilled by the organization’s leaders through training and indoctrination, promotion
criteria, and other techniques. Governance institutions often attract (and recruit) intermediaries of a particular
type. Institutions structured around performance-based compensation attract Opportunists. Institutions dominated by strong or charismatic leaders or patronage parties attract Vassals. Mission-oriented institutions – such
as environmental protection or law enforcement agencies and revolutionary parties – attract Zealots. And institutions with strong legalistic traditions and operating protocols, and merit-based recruitment – from courts to welfare administrations – attract Mandarins. These selection effects concentrate on a single type of loyalty within the
institution. The institutions that attract different intermediary types may also be more prominent in particular
polities: for example, institutions with performance-based compensation in Anglo-Saxon liberal democracies;
institutions with legalistic traditions in continental European democracies; institutions with strong policy orientations in revolutionary states; and institutions with strong leaders in authoritarian states.
Finally, it is important to note that real-world intermediaries rarely conform to the pure ideal types presented
here. Most intermediaries are blends of different types. First, an intermediary may simultaneously possess more
than one form of loyalty. An individual intermediary may be loyal to both her supervisor and her institution; a

Intermediary loyalty K. W. Abbott et al.
collective intermediary (e.g. a regulatory commission) may include some participants who are loyal to the
governor,22 others to the institution, still others to particular policies. Second, even loyal intermediaries typically
retain some, perhaps substantial, self-interest, while many Opportunists are also guided in part by loyalties. Such
mixed motivations can produce serious tensions when they conflict, shaping how particular intermediaries behave
and how governors can assert control. In addition, blended intermediaries may switch between motivations as
their social context changes; for example, the sudden opening of a window of opportunity may bring an
intermediary’s opportunistic motivations to the fore.
The tetrahedron in Figure 1 depicts these variations. The four vertices of the tetrahedron represent ideal type
Opportunists, Vassals, Zealots, and Mandarins. Points located on the edges, surfaces, and interior of the tetrahedron represent different combinations of motivations, at the individual or collective level.23 Despite the prevalence of hybrid commitments, however, understanding the pure ideal types remains an essential first step in
analyzing the intersecting commitments that characterize mixed cases.
The pure types provide a toolkit for unpacking the motivational complexity of individual intermediaries.
When President Trump contested the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, for example, many local election
officials were torn between party loyalty, the personal loyalty Trump demanded, loyalty to the norms and procedures of their office, and their own political prospects; officials balanced these motivations in very different ways.
The pure types also provide tools for unpacking disparate motivations within collective intermediaries. For
example, even where members of the Trump cabinet behaved similarly, as by lavishly praising the President,
some may have been Vassals, others Opportunists, still others Mandarins who felt praise was necessary to retain
a seat at the table.24
Finally, the pure types provide important guides for institutional design, as discussed further in Section 5.
Organizations, rules, and practices can be structured to promote and regulate the behavioral logics of each type,
as appropriate, even if actual intermediaries have blended motivations. In sum, only by understanding pure intermediary types can we appreciate the full range of possibilities and limitations for governance through
intermediaries.
3. Intermediary loyalty and the governor
In this section, we analyze the behavioral logics associated with the motivations of the four intermediary ideal
types, identifying the benefits and problems these create for the governor in terms of policy and control. The
presence of these logics can also be indicators of intermediary type, so long as they can be independently
observed. Again, we begin with Opportunists as a baseline, then contrast Vassals, Zealots, and Mandarins in turn.

3.1. Opportunists
Opportunists are self-seeking; they exploit their autonomy, often with guile, to further their own self-interest.
While the literature emphasizes the control problems this creates, self-seeking also produces significant advantages for governors. Opportunists are relatively easy to manage, through appropriate incentives and oversight,
including the threat of withdrawing incentives.25 Incentives are frequently material, but may also be ideational,
for example, status. Yet governors must be prepared to provide such incentives, as Opportunists cannot be managed in any other way.
Precisely because Opportunists have no loyalties to persons, policies, or institutions that might interfere with
their responding to incentives, they have a broad “zone of indifference” (Barnard 1938) within which the governor can steer their behavior. This makes Opportunists flexible and versatile. They can be incentivized to carry
out a wide spectrum of behaviors and activities. They are easy to hire: they will accept any position that pays sufficiently well. They are easy to direct: they will pivot to new goals, policies, procedures, or tasks when incentivized
to do so. Their sensitivity to incentives makes Opportunists ideal for tasks that require unthinking compliance
and disinterested execution, as in Taylorist institutions that seek to purge their members of any loyalties that
might interfere with “scientific management” (Fukuyama 2004, pp. 62–63). Responsiveness to incentives also
makes Opportunists convenient choices for doing the governor’s “dirty” work. For example, many companies
outsource layoffs to “outplacement services,” while governments outsource covert or unlawful military actions to
private security companies (Kruck 2020).
Opportunists are hired for their expertise and other competencies, and they invest in developing competencies that will help them obtain desirable positions. However, they are wary of competencies that are so governoror position-specific as to lock them into their current roles and hinder them from taking up more lucrative ones.
Opportunists prefer to invest in competencies that are marketable to diverse governors for diverse positions. This
preference reinforces their opportunism, impedes the development of stronger connections to their current governor and position, and limits their usefulness for governance functions that require governor- or position-specific
competencies.
Reliance on Opportunist intermediaries also carries control costs for governors. As the PA and RI literatures
emphasize, Opportunists are liable to slacking, slippage, capture, and other forms of agency loss. For example,
during the Cold War, the US military services systematically biased their estimates of Soviet nuclear missile capabilities – the Air Force high, the Army, and Navy low – to favor their own procurement budgets (Ellsberg 2017,
chapter 6). In the early 2000s, private credit rating agencies (CRAs) were often captured by the financial institutions they were tasked to regulate. To maintain lucrative contracts with their regulatory targets, CRAs issued
over-optimistic ratings that contributed to the global financial crisis (Kruck 2017).
3.2. Vassals
Vassals owe their allegiance to the governor personally. Hence, they are far less likely than Opportunists to
engage in slacking or slippage, submit to capture, or exercise guile vis-à-vis the governor. Rather, their devotion
leads them to exert strong efforts to achieve the governor’s goals. Thus, many governors, like Johnson and
Trump, are eager to enlist Vassals: “a newly elected presidential administration places the highest value on an
appointee’s unwavering commitment to the president and to his programs” (Edwards 2001).26
Because Vassals will do whatever the governor wants, the tight controls required for Opportunists are unnecessary. This reduces control costs and allows the governor to employ Vassals for tasks and activities she cannot
properly supervise. When the governing institutions of the Soviet Union began to fray in the 1980s, for example,
relations of personal loyalty largely took their place, structuring governance, and politics (Belton 2020).
Vassals’ devotion means that they can be induced to act through less costly means than can Opportunists.
Because of the emotional nature of their attachment, their most valued reward is proximity to the governor they
admire, along with recognition of the sacrifices they make on the governor’s behalf. These preferences allow governors to incentivize Vassals through the “carrots” of proximity and praise, and the “sticks” of exclusion and
shaming. Again, however, the governor must be prepared to provide sufficient proximity.
The Vassal’s dedication can buttress a governor’s rule in multiple ways. Governors can trust them with the
most important responsibilities of their rule. Personalist dictators such as Saddam Hussein, whose greatest

Intermediary loyalty K. W. Abbott et al.
concern is overthrow by elites, often place Vassals in high positions for this reason (Egorov & Sonin 2011; Ezrow
& Frantz 2011). Governors can also trust Vassals to bolster their authority through costly signals of fealty. In the
United States, for example, Vassals publicly lied for President Trump (Cowen 2017). In China, officials frequently
heap extravagant praise on the “thoughts” of party leaders, even though such “nauseating” bootlicking violates a
norm against cults of personality and forecloses recruitment by other leaders (Shih 2008).27
Vassals operate as direct extensions of the governor. This makes them valuable where a governance organization includes many Opportunists or loyalists left in place from previous administrations: Vassals will robustly
monitor and oversee these actors, enhancing the governor’s control. Vassals will likewise work diligently to fulfill
the governor’s policy promises to powerful coalition partners, allies, and other stakeholders, reinforcing the stability of the governor’s rule.28
Vassals’ personal allegiance means that they will carry out legally or morally questionable actions on behalf of
the governor. While Opportunists may engage in shady actions after a proper risk assessment and with sufficient
compensation, Vassals are willing to carry them out even at high personal risk, as Michael Cohen did for President Donald Trump, or as regional governors in Russia do in stuffing ballot boxes for the ruling party
(Koenig 2015). Vassals will often “go down with the ship,” remaining loyal to the governor even as legal or political problems pile up.
Importantly, Vassals will anticipate the governor’s wishes (even if questionable) and proactively work to fulfill
them, without explicit direction. For example, “when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the SS took the initiative to devise the methods of mass killing without orders to do so” (Snyder 2017, p. 19). No explicit command by
the Fuehrer was required.
Finally, Vassals will invest in expertise, skills, and other competencies specific to the needs of the governor;
these investments reinforce their allegiance. While some are specialists, Vassals often develop a broad range of
abilities; the frequent description of Michael Cohen as President Trump’s “fixer,” not just his lawyer, suggests the
breadth of the tasks he was assigned. Generalist Vassals will attend to any of the governor’s concerns, personal or
political, official or unofficial; they have no commitment to particular policies or practices. However, as “jacks of
all trades and master of none,” the competencies of generalist Vassals are often broad but shallow.
Indeed, Vassals are likely to be less competent on average than other intermediary types, as highly competent
actors are unlikely to accept positions that require servility and bootlicking. For example, Lyndon Johnson routinely humiliated his staff. As a result, only individuals personally devoted to him would join the staff, repeatedly
stymieing Johnson “in attempts to recruit talented individuals to work for him” (Caro 2002, p. 129). Governors
that prioritize personal loyalty must thus be willing to accept less competent intermediaries to obtain it (Abbott
et al. 2020).29 As Hannah Arendt observed: “lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their
loyalty” (Arendt 2004/1951, p. 339).
Beyond incompetence, governors face two significant problems with Vassals. First, because Vassals desire
privileged proximity to the governor, they engage in intrigue to keep other intermediaries at a distance, producing
infighting that undercuts effective governance. In the Nazi regime, for example, Martin Bormann maneuvered
constantly to prevent other officials from speaking to Hitler without Bormann’s permission and presence (von
Lang 1977). In China, members of political factions promote negative news coverage to discredit other faction
members (Chen & Hong 2020). The common practice of official “leaks” damaging to other officials may reflect
the ubiquity of Vassals.
Second, Vassals tend to over-comply with the governor’s wishes. They slavishly follow – or anticipate – the
governor’s whims, hints, and directions, even if these are poorly suited to achieving its goals or protecting its
authority. For example, four knights in service to Henry II (true vassals!) famously seized on Henry’s expression
of frustration to execute Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral, risking Henry’s excommunication and forcing
him to engage in public penance. In addition, Vassals are often “yes-men” (Prendergast 1993): they withhold
adverse information so as not to undermine their relationship with the governor (Wintrobe 1998).
Imposing tight controls to avoid these problems may actually worsen them. Close supervision may lead a
Vassal to conclude that the governor does not respect its sacrifices, generating resentment. A spurned Vassal is
dangerous, especially if it has been privy to the governor’s most personal, even secret actions. Under strong pressure, the Vassal may eventually abandon its personal loyalty, turn on the governor, and cause it harm out of spite,
as Michael Cohen did.30

3.3. Zealots
Zealots are loyal to specific policies or principles; they devote their attention, energies, and resources to furthering
those policies or principles. This focus can create important benefits for governors whose goals coincide with
Zealots’ policy commitments. Where they do, Zealots are less likely than Opportunists to slack and slip, less vulnerable to capture, and less likely to exercise guile vis-à-vis the governor.
Zealots’ most valued reward is autonomy to pursue their preferred policies. Like Vassals, then, they are less
costly than Opportunists to employ: as Gailmard and Patty (2007) argue, governors can provide Zealots with policy discretion as a partial alternative to monetary compensation, but must be prepared to grant such discretion.
Where their favored policies coincide with the governor’s goals, moreover, Zealots enable governors to economize
on control costs: like Vassals, Zealots will pursue those policies without direction or supervision. For example,
the United States was able to oust the Soviet Union and its puppet regime from Afghanistan simply by providing
material support to the Mujaheddin, who were even more strongly opposed to Soviet rule than was the United
States.
Zealots are particularly valuable where governors seek to implement policy changes. So long as the changes
are consistent with their policy commitments, Zealots will fully employ their knowledge, skill, and energy as
agents of change. They are often resourceful policy entrepreneurs, identifying creative ways to further their
favored policies, and stifle opposition. When President Trump sought to roll back US environmental regulations,
for example, he did not order incumbent officials of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to do so;
instead, he installed as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a “leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda”
who had frequently sued the agency (Pollack 2020). Conversely, governors seeking to lock in preferred policies
may “burrow” Zealots into positions where their tenure will continue into the terms of subsequent governors.
Zealots can help governors make credible policy commitments to third parties, including other governors,
coalition partners, supporters, markets, or the targets of regulation. As is well-known, governors can increase
credibility by granting control of the relevant policies to independent institutional “trustees,” such as central
banks or constitutional courts; but they gain even more credibility by staffing these institutions with relentless
Zealots, such as conservative economists for central banks and rights advocates for constitutional courts
(Rogoff 1985).
Zealots have a strong interest in policy expertise specific to their favored goals, and will invest heavily to
develop it; these investments further reinforce their policy commitments. However, they will not develop broader
competencies not directly relevant to their policy commitments. As a result, Zealots have a narrower scope of
operation than either Opportunists or Vassals.
For governors, the principal problem with relying on Zealots is over-commitment. In contrast to Opportunists and Vassals, Zealots are inflexible. They cannot easily be steered to support different policies; while they may
strike strategic compromises that advance their favored policies, Zealots otherwise resist balancing competing
considerations or making policy tradeoffs. Once the Soviet puppet regime in Afghanistan was overthrown, for
example, the Mujaheddin refused to stop fighting, even though their US patron urged them to do so.
Over-commitment may also make Zealots more ruthless than the governor wishes. For example, in 1948 the
Polish communist regime authorized the Ministry of Public Security (Bezpieka) to repress mass opposition. Once
empowered, however, Bezpieka leaders engaged in massive purges that extended to party members in the state
bureaucracy and military, threatening regime stability (Thomson 2020).
Because Zealots value policy discretion, they resist any attempt to steer, oversee, or control them: Zealots see
such measures as interfering with, or at least distracting from, pursuit of their favored policies. Zealots therefore
pose political difficulties for governors that pursue diverse policies, operate in rapidly changing environments,
and must contend with diverse interest groups.
When a governor adopts policies inconsistent with Zealots’ favored policies, or does not pursue those policies
with sufficient zeal, Zealots will either undercut the governor’s policies or exit their intermediary positions.
Zealots who exit often do so noisily, publicly criticizing the governor for its lack of understanding, commitment,
or even morality. While Vassals may go down with the ship, Zealots will sink the ship if they think the governor
is steering it toward the wrong shore. For example, when the NGO Global Witness left the Kimberley Process on
conflict diamonds, which it had helped to create, it charged that the Process had “become an accomplice to

diamond laundering” (Global Witness 2011). Similarly, after serving as national security advisor, John Bolton (2020) wrote a scathing critique of President Trump as uninformed, impulsive, and self-serving in foreign
policy.
3.4. Mandarins
Mandarins are loyal to the ethos, traditions, and protocols of their institution, not to the person of its leader or to
any particular policies. They are devoted to the fundamental rules, roles, and practices of the institution, out of
allegiance to its mission and culture.
Institutional loyalty produces important benefits for governors. Mandarins work hard to advance the institution’s mission, ensuring institutional continuity and stability. They eschew personal goals that detract from that
mission, and are less susceptible than Opportunists to capture and corruption. In addition, Mandarins – like
other loyalists – are less costly to employ: they will sacrifice material compensation for tenure with the institution
and support for its mission. In exchange, however, a governor must be prepared to provide institutional support.
Mandarins are far less likely than Vassals to become yes-men; they will stand up to the governor if they sense
that its policies or actions pose risks to the institution. Starting in the 19th century, for example, the “ethos of
office” of senior British civil servants – widely referred to as “mandarins” – included “willingness to offer frank
and fearless advice without regard to personal consequences.” This enabled the “mandarinate … to fulfil a constitutional role as a sort of ‘gyroscope of state’ … helping to provide … the stability, continuity and institutional
memory deemed necessary for responsible, efficient and effective government” (du Gay 2009, p. 265).
Mandarins will accept governor supervision and control that are part of the institutional script, but will object
to controls that go beyond it. They can also be relied on to pursue the institution’s mission where supervision
and control are difficult to apply, for example, where a governor orchestrates the activities of intermediary institutions on a voluntary basis (e.g. Blauberger & Rittberger 2015). Institutional loyalty offers flexible levers of control:
the “carrots” of enhancing the institution’s role and the Mandarin’s tenure within it, and the “sticks” of threatening to marginalize them. Mandarins thus reduce control costs, while providing continuity and stability.
Unlike Zealots, Mandarins will accept policy changes, tradeoffs, and compromises so long as these are consistent with the institution’s fundamental norms and traditions; on the latter, they strongly resist change or compromise. Relying on Mandarins thus helps governors credibly signal to third parties that they will uphold
institutional norms such as the rule of law, much as relying on Zealots increases the credibility of policy commitments. When Joseph Biden took office as US President, for example, to assure the public that the justice system
would not be politicized, he urged his nominee for Attorney-General to act as a Mandarin: “Your loyalty is not
to me. It is to the law, to the Constitution, to the people ….” (Washington Post 2021). Similarly, Mandarins can
support the governor’s agreements – with opponents as well as allies – because all sides can rely on them to
implement the agreements faithfully according to institutional rules.
Mandarins invest in expertise, skills, and other competencies that benefit their institution. Such institutionspecific competencies include knowledge of the institution’s traditions and protocols, and skill in implementing
its procedures. Institution-specific competencies are less widely marketable than those of Opportunists, binding
the Mandarin ever more tightly to its current institution.31
From the governor’s perspective, the principal problem with Mandarins is their over-conservatism. Mandarins hew strongly to established institutional traditions, norms, procedures, and practices, even when a governor
desires flexibility. While their cautious advice can be valuable, it is often steeped in institutional traditions and
instinctively critical of policy innovation. Mandarins’ rule compliance can thus be an exasperating obstacle to
governors seeking flexibility or fundamental change. Yet the same conservatism allows a governor to lock in its
policies through subsequent administrations by instantiating them in institutional rules and practices, to be defended by Mandarins.
Mandarins strongly resist demands for behavior potentially damaging to the institution. In 1973, for example,
US President Nixon ordered Attorney General Eliot Richardson to fire the special prosecutor investigating the
Watergate scandal. In the “Saturday Night Massacre,” Richardson – followed by his deputy William Ruckelshaus
– resigned rather than carry out the order, accelerating moves to impeach Nixon. Unlike Zealots, Mandarins
S92 © 2021 The Authors. Regulation & Governance published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.
K. W. Abbott et al. Intermediary loyalty
generally resign quietly (often guided by institutional norms), but their resignations are strong signals to the outside world that can be costly to the governor.
Because Mandarins are committed to a specific institution, their behaviors – positive and negative – vary with
the nature of that institution and their role within it. For example, where the institutional ethos is independence,
as in the Department of Justice and the courts, Mandarins resist political influence. James Comey, as Director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, resisted pressure from President Trump to refrain from investigating Russian
interference in the US presidential election (Comey 2018). Similarly, the Security Council in 2002 authorized the
UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) to search for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq. The US pressured Hans Blix, UNMOVIC’s director, to confirm that WMD existed. Instead,
Blix maintained UNMOVIC’s independence, adhered to established UN protocols, and insisted that it could find
no WMD, depriving the US of Security Council authorization to invade Iraq (Thompson 2020).
Where the institutional ethos is faithful implementation of political appointees’ directives, in contrast, as in
the British civil service, Mandarins will obediently follow inconsistent directions from new governors; as one British undersecretary said when praised for implementing a new program, “I have to tell you of course that if the
next Government tells me to undo it I shall undo it just as efficiently” (Ribbins & Sherrat 2015). Mandarins follow standard operating procedures closely, sometimes slavishly and legalistically; when they make decisions “that
you do not like, they defend themselves by saying ‘Sorry, those are the rules’” (Barnett & Finnemore 1999,
p. 708). An organizational culture of routinization and “operating by the books” reinforces such behaviors
(Id.: 718; Knill et al. 2019, p. 5).
Table 2 summarizes the key benefits and problems that the four intermediary types create for governors.
4. Intermediary loyalty and the public interest
The previous section considered how loyalist and opportunistic intermediaries further (or hamper) the governor’s
interests. In this section, we ask whether and how the four intermediary types further the public interest.32 The
answer depends on whether the governor’s interests are positively or negatively correlated with the public
interest.
Where the interests of the governor and the public are aligned, each intermediary type, in its characteristic
fashion, furthers the public interest by enabling the governor to regulate and govern effectively – even if its
actions do not comport with standard notions of good governance.33 For example, when Vassals – whose personal loyalty may appear damaging to the public interest – coordinate disparate governance processes or promote
publicly responsive governance to shore up the governor’s political support, they are also serving the public interest, even if only inadvertently. This explains why even liberal democracies allow leaders to select loyal political
appointees for key staff positions. Conversely, although Mandarin rule-following is generally thought to protect
good governance from political abuse, it may instead harm the public interest by impeding effective action. During the Rwanda crisis, for example, Mandarins in the UN Secretariat withdrew peacekeeping forces, facilitating

the ensuing genocide, because of their adherence to the established institutional culture of consent-based peacekeeping (Barnett & Finnemore 2004, chapter 5).
Where the interests of the governor and the public diverge, in contrast, governance intermediaries best serve
the public interest by constraining the governor and channeling its actions toward the public interest. For regulatory policy and institutional design, these are the broadest and most significant implications of intermediary
loyalty.
Here we consider two sets of constraints.34 First, public transparency and governor accountability enable the
public to constrain the governor directly and to demand actions that further its interests. Second, checks and balances and an intermediary’s willingness to serve successor governors enable other governance actors to constrain
the current governor indirectly, on behalf of the public. While other constraints are also relevant, these four
enable us to observe how tensions between the governor’s interests and the public interest play out in practice.
We consider in turn how each type of intermediary promotes these principles.
4.1. Opportunists
Opportunist intermediaries enhance governor accountability. Because their actions are known to be controlled by
the incentives and contractual mandates the governor establishes, Opportunists are direct “transmission belts” for
the governor’s decisions. They create a clear chain of accountability from the governor to the public: the governor
cannot evade responsibility for failures of its policies or deflect blame for those failures onto Opportunist intermediaries. However, Opportunists have no independent motivation to promote public transparency; they will provide complete and truthful disclosures to the public only if incentivized or mandated to do so. Thus,
Opportunists rarely act as “whistleblowers,” revealing improper acts of the governor, unless doing so promises
significant rewards (or not doing so carries costs).
Likewise, Opportunists provide few if any checks and balances against the governor. They have no incentive
to constrain excessive exercises of authority; indeed, they are likely to follow the governor’s directions even where
these harm the public interest, so long as doing so will keep their personal gains secure.
However, Opportunists willingly serve successor governors: so long as a successor provides sufficiently attractive incentives, Opportunists will pivot to serve the new governor, its policies and its institutional arrangements,
ensuring the successor’s ability to govern effectively. Their flexibility also facilitates smooth transitions of authority, and so is especially important in democracies, where turnover among elected officials is relatively frequent.
Most importantly, the prospect that the public may choose a successor governor who can smoothly take power
and govern effectively provides a powerful check on the behavior of the current governor.
Finally, Opportunists have even broader public interest implications: they tend to skew public policy in the
direction of further opportunism. Because they themselves respond only to incentives, they are most comfortable
with incentive-based policies and personnel arrangements, and tend to favor them even when they are not in the
public interest. More importantly, the actions of Opportunists may trigger a general public understanding that
governance is driven by private interests and incentives, leading to cynicism and distrust of governance
institutions.
4.2. Vassals
Vassals may contribute to governor accountability: because they obediently follow the governor’s wishes and are
known to be beholden to the governor, their relationship creates a direct chain of accountability from the governor to the public, even more than Opportunists. Yet Vassals have no incentive to promote public transparency
except where the governor directs them to do so or where they proactively see truthful disclosures as furthering
the governor’s interests. Thus, Vassals rarely become whistleblowers, unless, like Michael Cohen, they have
turned decisively against the governor. Even worse, Vassals may actively undermine transparency and accountability – especially where they have participated in illicit activities on behalf of the governor – concealing or misleading the public as to the governor’s decisions, actions, and responsibilities to shield it from public scrutiny and
criticism.
Vassals’ willingness to “go down with the ship” further erodes transparency. In general, “exit” from a governance relationship sends socially valuable signals of trouble (Hirschman 1970), but Vassals unwilling to abandon
S94 © 2021 The Authors. Regulation & Governance published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.
K. W. Abbott et al. Intermediary loyalty
their relationships with the governor cannot send such signals. One partial exception is the eagerness of Vassals
to “leak” information that will undercut rivals. Here the intrigue among Vassals that harms governance effectiveness may actually benefit the public interest in transparency, but may instead undermine public trust in information provided by the governor’s entourage.
Vassals provide no checks and balances against the governor. Worse, they willingly help the governor to circumvent or violate whatever checks and balances exist, so as to buttress the governor’s personal authority and
further its interests. As noted above, Vassals will also engage in shady or extra-legal behavior to support the governor’s rule. Kleinig (2014) points to the behavior of President Nixon’s staff during and after Watergate in
suggesting that personal loyalty may “produce renunciation of moral judgement.”
35
Because Vassals are personally loyal to the incumbent governor, they will not transfer their loyalty to a successor governor, and any successor will not trust them. These effects limit the successor’s governance effectiveness, and thus the check on the current governor posed by the possibility that a successor will be selected.
Even worse, Vassals may continue to advance the interests of the previous governor after a successor takes
office, undercutting its effectiveness. For precisely this reason, outgoing governors often embed Vassals in
carry-over positions, while successors replace inherited Vassals when possible, even if they possess valuable
expertise.
More broadly, Vassals facilitate personal rule by the governor (or group rule by, e.g., the party). Vassals will
do whatever it takes to keep their governor in power, including actively supporting authoritarian actions and even
authoritarian rule. For this reason, governors – especially in faltering democracies such as Hungary and Poland,
but even in the United States – have politicized personnel selection (Peters & Pierre 2004), installing Vassals to
strengthen their rule and rein in any threat from a “deep state.” These actions transfer and even amplify political
polarization from society to governance, producing deep and abrupt policy shifts with each change in partisan
control.
Because they operate on the basis of fealty, moreover, Vassals may favor the expansion of fealty-based patronage systems, which rarely serve the public interest. Finally, Vassals’ practice of personal loyalty may further a general public belief that governance depends on personal connections, fueling venality and corruption.
4.3. Zealots
Zealots will openly protest actions by the governor that diverge from their favored policy goals. They will “speak
(their) truth to the public,” whether still in office or exiting noisily, and will act as whistleblowers where the governor’s policy actions are improper. These measures further public transparency. As independent champions of
policies, however, Zealots break the chain of governor accountability; unlike Opportunists and Vassals, Zealots’
policy independence makes them easy targets for blame-shifting by the governor.
Zealots also provide limited checks and balances: they will push back against the governor’s decisions, but
only where these diverge from the Zealots’ favored policies. Similarly, Zealots will serve a successor governor,
but only if it supports their policy priorities. Where it does not, Zealots will refuse to implement the successor’s
policies – even if they have been ratified by democratic election – or will exit their positions. These limitations
impede smooth governance transitions and successor effectiveness, undermining the threat of selecting a successor as a constraint on the current governor.
More broadly, absolutist attitudes toward policy goals sometimes lead Zealots to extreme measures, antidemocratic or even dictatorial in nature. During revolutions, for example, Zealots with “utopian” policy visions
(Scott 1998, p. 89) may go so far as to kill people to advance policies they believe to be in the public interest, as
both leaders and intermediaries did in the French, Bolshevik, and Communist Chinese revolutions. Robespierre
famously argued that it is not sufficient for popular revolutionary governments to pursue virtue; they must combine it with terror, as virtue without terror is impotent (Robespierre 1794). Most Zealots, of course, have more
limited policy visions and behave less lethally.
Because Zealots are policy-focused, they favor technocratic governance arrangements that assign policymaking to experts, insulating it from public influence and political controls. Finally, the actions of Zealots may
further a broad public understanding that governance has been captured by technocrats and true believers, with

Intermediary loyalty K. W. Abbott et al.
no respect for opposing views and no allowance for moderation, compromise, or temperance – much as in Communist states where policy is made by the party, not the government.
4.4. Mandarins
Mandarins, like Zealots, break the chain of direct governor accountability to the public. Their loyalty is to their institution, distinct from the current governor, and the governor may blame them for impeding its effectiveness. And
Mandarins are less likely than Zealots to go public with complaints about the governor’s actions, reducing public
transparency. To protect the institution, they prefer to engage in voice, working from within to reverse the governor’s actions and prevent their reoccurrence, or to pursue “internal immigration,” separating themselves from the
improper conduct to continue working in their own sphere. Where threats to the institution are egregious, however,
Mandarins will become whistleblowers or – like Attorney-General Richardson – resign from office, enlisting intervention by other branches of government, the press, and other societal actors to protect the institution.
Mandarins provide robust checks and balances against governors who threaten the principles, rules, and traditions of their institutions. Mandarins such as Blix and Comey will actively push back when governors try to evade
institutional norms or bend institutional procedures to their own benefit. This intransigence is especially important
where institutions are designed to act independently, as with prosecutorial institutions like the Department of Justice, investigative agencies like the FBI or UNMOVIC, and courts. Mandarins’ institutional fidelity stabilizes the
formal and informal constitutional “guard rails” that dampen the volatility of ordinary politics and restrain the
exercise of political power. Indeed, most institutional checks and balances, such as separation of powers, require
Mandarins willing to assert institutional prerogatives. Where legislators or other relevant actors are personally loyal
to the governor or loyal to its policies, in contrast, institutional checks and balances will fail.
Mandarins willingly serve successor governors, even those with divergent policy goals, if their institutional
mandates require it – but only to the extent the successors uphold institutional traditions, rules and protocols,
and protect Mandarins’ roles in those institutions. Thus, Mandarins provide especially valuable constraints where
incumbent governors violate institutional principles to strengthen their personal rule.
More broadly, Mandarins can come to embody narrow institutional interests, creating bureaucratic pathologies (Barnett & Finnemore 2004) such as maximizing the institution’s budget, being overly protective of its
public reputation, or maintaining it beyond its usefulness. These actions may further a public understanding
that governance consists of impenetrable rules concocted in Kafka’s castle. Equally serious, fealty to an institution (including the state itself ), and exaggerated concern over apparent threats to that institution, can lead
Mandarins to view themselves as guardians of the institution at all costs; they begin to act as a “deep state,”
insulated from public demands, political controls, and even democratic change (Watmough 2017).

5. Conclusion: From intermediary type to institutional design
This paper broadens the study of indirect governance to address the diverse natures of intermediaries themselves.
While variations in intermediary characteristics have occasionally been noted in the literature (e.g. Hawkins &
Jacoby 2006; Gailmard & Patty 2007), the dominant tendency has been to view intermediaries as undifferentiated
“opportunists”: faceless, self-interested actors. In fact, however, intermediaries often possess loyalties, and these
vary widely – Opportunists to self, Vassals to governors, Zealots to policies, and Mandarins to institutions. Theorizing this variation allows us to understand intermediary agency more fully, as something not just to control but
equally to harness. This opens fruitful lines of research.
The first step is to better understand the motivations of governance intermediaries: how do they exercise their
autonomy? Earlier we noted that the four ideal types we identify can be used to unravel the complex motivations
of individual and collective intermediaries. The next step is to analyze their behavioral logics in greater detail.
How do actors become socialized to particular loyalties (or to opportunism)? How do they prepare themselves
for governance positions consistent with their loyalties? How do they position themselves to be selected for such
positions? How do they behave in particular roles?
Governors can best harness intermediary loyalties by selecting the appropriate types or combination of types
for particular governance positions and tasks: to be effective, a governor must have the right “people” (including
organizations) in the right positions. The selection of appropriate intermediaries can also ameliorate control
problems – as governance practitioners know well. But how do governors screen and identify the “right” people?
How do they determine in what positions to place them? Do current procedures allow them to make these determinations appropriately?
Governors must also take account of the specific motivations of intermediaries to manage them effectively.
While loyal intermediaries are less prone than Opportunists to self-interested slacking, slippage, and capture –
hitherto the central concerns of the indirect governance literature – they respond to very different “carrots” and
“sticks.” Thus, although the incentives, monitoring, and hierarchical control mechanisms of PA theory remain
important (Carpenter & Moss 2014; Maggetti et al. 2017), a governor must also deploy a wider range of inducements and deterrents – including personal proximity (Vassals), policy autonomy (Zealots), and institutional security (Mandarins) – to address the particular behavioral dispositions of its intermediaries.
How do governors manage intermediaries of different types? How do their management strategies contribute
to policy success or failure? Institutional design is important here, as governors must be authorized and enabled
to use appropriate management tools. Are current rules well-designed for this purpose? More generally, why do
some governor-intermediary relationships fail even with seemingly coincident motivations, while others succeed
in the face of non-coincident motivations?
Serving the public interest is the ultimate goal of governance, but not necessarily of the governor. The public
– that is, the people as sovereign – can narrow this gap both directly, by controlling the governor, and indirectly,
by shaping the governor’s choice of intermediaries. The institutions through which governance intermediaries are
educated, developed, identified, selected, and managed are key to this.
Here institutional design becomes central. Even quotidian institutional arrangements such as selection rules,
confirmation procedures, and civil service protections on hiring, promotion, and dismissal enable the public to
promote the selection of intermediaries with the “right” loyalties for particular positions – loyalties that benefit
the public interest – and to prevent the selection of those with the “wrong” loyalties. How do current rules and
procedures serve this function, and how can they be improved? Making these determinations is not straightforward but requires nuanced analysis of the governance contributions and limitations of different intermediary
types. One need not always understand the motivations of specific empirical actors, however; simply knowing the
types of actors that may appear, and the types governors are prone to select for particular tasks, provides guidance in designing institutions suitable for diverse possibilities.
Finally, intermediaries of appropriate types can constrain a governor with divergent interests and steer its
actions toward the public interest. Again, institutional design is crucial. Depending on the specific governance
problems at hand, intermediaries are differentially effective at making the governor’s behavior transparent and
accountable to the public; institutional arrangements that protect intermediaries from political interference, enable
and protect whistle-blowers, and require disclosures can promote transparency and accountability.

Intermediary loyalty K. W. Abbott et al.
For situations where the governor might deviate more severely from the public interest, appropriate intermediaries can provide checks and balances that keep the governor in line; but only if institutional arrangements provide them the leverage to do so. The ultimate check on a governor who fails to serve the public interest is to
replace her; but for replacement to be a credible prospect, it is essential that intermediaries willing to serve the
successor be installed in key positions, and that any successor be able to replace embedded intermediaries loyal to
its predecessor. Considering intermediary loyalties is essential to getting these institutional arrangements right.
In all these settings, recognizing, harnessing, and controlling intermediary loyalty is central both to facilitating
effective governance and to constraining excessive accumulations of authority and despotic or harmful actions.
The difficult tasks are to mobilize the virtues of opportunistic and diversely loyal intermediaries in service to the
public interest, while avoiding the corruption, fanaticism, and red tape that loyalty often brings in its wake.</p>

ABSTRACT
The Libri feudorum is a composite law book containing the
customary laws of fiefs held in Lombardy which were codified in
1100–1250. Its function in shaping a late medieval ‘feudal
vocabulary’ and, ultimately, modern models of feudalism was
highlighted by Susan Reynolds and lies at the core of her antifeudalism paradigm. This paper questions the disjuncture
between social practice and learned law that underlies the
paradigm, by analysing the context and making of the Libri
feudorum and of legal writings associated with it – by Pillius de
Medicina, Iacobus de Ardizone and Jean Blanc. By showing how
practice could shape legal tools used by learned lawyers to frame
fiefs and by reassessing the influence of the Libri feudorum on
practice, the paper challenges the idea that fiefs were the
outcome of professional or academic law and unveils aspects of
the practical nature and intellectual dimension of lawyerly writing.

Investiture Controversy, Albert betrayed them at least twice. Once he had been chosen
as Matilda’s successor, he swore allegiance to Emperor Lothair III; soon after,
however, he broke his oath and secretly backed the emperor’s rival, Conrad Hohenstaufen. Nonetheless, when he had to face an uprising by the former Canossa followers (‘capitanei, valvasores et cuncti satellites domus comitissae Mathildis’),3 he
did not think twice before crawling back to Lothair. In his letter to Lothair – a
display of opportunism and realpolitik – Albert strategically depicted the rebellion
as a disgraceful act of treason and himself as a good, generous lord, who had
humbly and almost reluctantly accepted his leading role. These greedy noblemen,
he wrote, had consumed all his wealth by reclaiming gifts of all kinds and, when
he had nothing left to give, they kidnapped his wife and occupied Canossa. When
Albert seemed to have recovered the loyalty of these followers, one of them, Rainerius
de Saxo, who apparently had held Canossa as a fief, retook the castle in an act of
great treachery (‘cum magna prodicione’) and imprisoned Albert’s two sons, causing
incalculable damage to his honour.4
The picture provided by the noblemen in their response to Lothair presents a wholly
different state of affairs. Their betrayal was now described as a legitimate reaction
against a greedy and treacherous lord: Albert, they wrote, had conspired to hand
Canossa to Conrad Hohenstaufen, who had usurped the royal title (‘invasor nominis
regis’), in return for an immense amount of money. The kidnapping of Albert’s wife
was now depicted as her voluntary call for help to prevent Albert’s betrayal. The noblemen
complained that after Albert persuaded them to return the castle, he ceased to behave as a
lord and retired to Verona, and they never saw him again. His two sons, whom he left in
Canossa and who were now described as illegitimate, committed a series of offences, not
least the imprisonment of an innocent nobleman, the son of Rainerius de Saxo, who in
return took the castle and incarcerated the two felons.5
The subtext of these letters helps us understand how the bonds tying some of the great
nobility in early twelfth-century Italy were not subject to fixed rules but, on the contrary,
needed to be renewed through a constant exchange of gifts and counter-gifts – sometimes
in the form of expected behaviours or services.6 Interestingly, these letters were inserted in
a Tractatus de dictamine composed in Lombardy about a decade later, around 1135, at the
same time and place as the first tracts of the earliest known collection of feudal law, the
Libri feudorum [LF], were written. If one is to believe this law book, treason was itself
sufficient cause to lose a fief (LF 1.16); yet not only did the parties refrain from invoking
any specific penalty, but they seemed much more focused on depicting themselves, or
feigning so to depict themselves, as keen to compromise: Albert wanted the restitution
of the castle and to win back his followers’ loyalty; the followers declared themselves
willing to obey him only if he behaved as a good lord. The emperor, in an attempt to
keep peace in the kingdom and secure military aid for his forthcoming campaign, promised to judge the case in person and appraise whether Rainerius had held Canossa as a fief
or as castle-guard (‘pro feudo an pro custodia’) – an important distinction, since, according to LF 1.2, a castle-guard fief (feudum guardie) was not a proper fief because it could be

recovered by the lord at the end of the agreed term.7 However, it would be futile to look for
further correlations between the strategies deployed by these parties and other norms contained in the LF. On the contrary, informal norms, status, timely violence and rhetorical
skills contributed to shaping such negotiations and the very nature of political relationships. In other words, they did not necessarily conform to written law or any other set
of objectified rules.8 Equally, the LF and later literature on fiefs are utterly silent on all
such matters, which so often remained implicit, untold, even though in practice they sustained this kind of relationship.
The main idea underlying this article is that comparative analysis of the sources
recounting real practice – including archival sources – and the rules collected and
‘codified’ in law books and legal literature can help us bridge their disjuncture. The argument challenges the idea that legal literature, including the LF, was a product of a scholarly
milieu fundamentally unconcerned with actual social developments. In other words, it
challenges a notion that informs most of the debates that have followed Susan Reynolds’
deconstruction of modern models of feudalism. One of the main achievements of Reynolds’ works is the discovery of the influence of the LF on such models. The history of
the book, indeed, would seem to speak in her favour.9 The first known version of the
LF, conventionally called antiqua, appeared in Lombardy shortly after 1150 as an assemblage of seven earlier tracts. Five of them are dated to c.1100–30, while the last two were
written c.1150 by the Milanese judge and politician Obertus de Orto. All these tracts
related to an ordinance issued in 1037 by which Emperor Conrad II secured the possessions which the Milanese military elite held of the archbishop of Milan. The authors of the
LF interpreted this decree in light of local customs and provided partial, occasionally
inconsistent, insights into the substantive and procedural law to be followed in disputes
over fiefs. They implicitly deemed fiefs to be property held by the military class. After
some decades of textual sedimentation and augmentation, mostly taking place in Milan,
a second phase of codification concluded by c.1180. At this stage, the LF drew the attention
of lawyers trained in Bologna: the first was Pillius de Medicina, who produced a glossae
apparatus and a brief commentary on the code. In the early thirteenth century, other
jurists produced commentaries and recompilations of the LF. The tradition commented
upon by Pillius was supplemented with new texts, including legislation of Frederick I
and Lothair III, and was accepted as a standard version by Accursius, the most influential
law professor of the time. About 1250, Accursius completed the apparatus of Pillius’ gloss
and had the text copied in the new editions of the Corpus iuris civilis produced in
Bologna.10 Therefore, a text originally anchored in the local custom of Lombardy now
had the potential to reach law schools across Europe.

As Reynolds suggested, the generalisation of a ‘feudal’ vocabulary was made possible
by the influence exerted by this text on lawyers. The spread of properties or tenures
called fiefs would be the outcome of imposing the learned terms inspired by the LF
on different customary realities.11 Her book, Fiefs and Vassals, however, tends to
imply such influence rather than analysing the way it developed. In what follows, therefore, this article assesses the relationship between the LF and the literature associated
with it on the one hand, and the sphere of practice and of ‘customary’ norms on the
other. To do so, it attempts to set aside traditional narratives depicting the rise of the
ius commune as an intellectual construct developing in contrast with an allegedly
more natural customary law.12 Rather, it is necessary to escape the narrow field of property law and envisage the norms of fief-giving not as the execution of formalised rules,
but in terms of the use of cultural models by interested actors.13 In this way, the LF and
the literature associated with it may be reinterpreted as products of specific social and
political contexts. This operation, of course, entails several risks. It should not assume
an a priori divide between legal science on the one hand and the values and customary
norms embedded in the social fabric on the other. Neither ought it to imply the existence
of shared social practice whenever codified norms emerge nor expect ‘the highly ambiguous vocabulary of rules … to express a social practice that in fact obeys quite different
principles’.
14 One last risk concerns terminology: to avoid possible confusion, the term
custom is used here to refer to a source of law and legal decisions. The expressions customary rules and customary norms fit Max Weber’s definition of legal norms: regularities
in social behaviour connected to sanctions enforceable by specialised staff.
15 When the
sources employ the terms consuetudo or usus with ambiguous meanings, however,
their Latin forms are retained.
The article focuses on northern Italy and the French Midi, two areas whose role in the
making of feudalism – whether a medieval reality or a learned construct – has been long
acknowledged.16 The first section deals with twelfth-century Lombardy and describes how
the earliest stages in the codification of the LF developed in close contact with shifting

practices and power relationships – the decline of archiepiscopal power and the rise of the
city commune – in which fief-giving seems to have been governed by norms that were
often dependant on the relative status of the parties. The legal experts who wrote the
LF were not external observers of this reality. Together with the noblemen who were at
the centre of the exchange of fiefs, they were part of the ruling class, interested actors
in the establishment of the municipal government, of its institutions and of its Romanising
legal procedures.
The second section considers how the works of three lawyers were influenced, and to
some extent even shaped, by different socio-institutional backgrounds, thus stressing the
relationship between the sphere of practice and the making of learned law. Firstly, it examines the circumstances in which the Italian glossator Pillius de Medicina developed the
notion of dominium utile, a legal device that distinguished the rights retained by the
lord from those transmitted to the fief-holder, a theory that was of paramount importance
in post-medieval representations of power. Secondly, it shows how practices of rural lordship contributed to shaping the notion of custom in the work of another Italian glossator,
Iacobus de Ardizone. Finally, the example of Jean Blanc, a learned lawyer and a diplomat
in Provence, highlights a particular, generally undervalued aspect of the inner logic of the
ius commune, namely the abstraction of general rules from specific cases, their transmission and re-contextualisation. This last example connects directly to the third
section, which puts in perspective the possible impact of the LF on learned law and practice before 1250.
Fiefs and the Libri feudorum in Milan
This section appraises the relationship between the LF and the social context where the
texts composing this book were produced. The five earliest tracts are by unknown
authors – except for one, Ugo de Gambolado, a judge and consul from Pavia – and
were all probably written between 1100 and the early 1130s. They all discuss, in the
light of local practice, how a fief could be acquired, held, lost or transmitted to heirs,
who ought to judge disputes about fiefs, and how. These texts were either written in Lombardy, perhaps Pavia, or in other milieux deeply influenced by the Lombard law school,
which had flourished in the eleventh century. All their authors, indeed, show some interest
in an old decree that was still, and would be later, deemed of great importance with regard
to fiefs and which was included in the collection of imperial laws known as Lombarda.
17 It
was enacted in 1037 by Emperor Conrad II, who was faced with an uprising by the military
clientele of the archbishop of Milan, the main political figure in Lombardy and ruler of the
wealthiest and most powerful city in north Italy. Conrad satisfied the requests of the
knights who held archiepiscopal land and who were complaining about the insecurity
of their possessions. He pronounced that these possessions had to be heritable and that
holders could be deprived of them only for wrongs proved before their equals.

He eventually accorded to holders the right to appeal: from high noblemen to the emperor
himself, from lesser men to the imperial missi.
18
When the authors of the LF wrote their commentaries on this decree, the political situation had radically changed. In the eleventh century, the Milanese military elite at the
centre of this tumult was a restricted group of families divided into two composite categories, capitanei and valvasores, respectively greater and lesser knights. In the early
twelfth century, some of their successors, namely those who had managed to build
strong connections with the city, were regularly elected consules, the rotating office that
is seen as the first expression of communal government. At that time, the archbishop,
who was also the main landowner in Milanese territory, could not afford to lose their
backing without facing potentially disastrous consequences. Between 1050 and 1150 five
archbishops were deposed, one of whom was even imprisoned after opposing the antiimperial policy enforced by the Milanese elite.19
This consular elite, however, was quite heterogeneous in the early twelfth century.
Alongside the military elite, it included an increasing number of legal experts
(iudices), who drove the process of institutionalisation of the commune.20 The
primary function of these officials was judicial: groups of consuls presided collectively
over the city court and their judgements, usually on ‘rural land, and often feudal and
signorial rights as well’, were pronounced by one consul, generally a judge, with the
consent of the others.21 The legal experts who were regularly elected consuls, including
some of the authors of the LF, were not, or not just, academic or professional lawyers.
They were interested agents in the making of the city-state. Ugo de Gambolado, the
author of one of our tracts, was in 1112 a judge and consul of Pavia.22 The Milanese
judge Obertus de Orto (d. c.1171), who wrote the two last tracts of the antiqua
version of the LF, was elected consul of Milan at least eight times between 1140 and
1171. The other two Milanese lawyers mentioned in texts attached to the LF in the
late twelfth century, Stephanardus and Gerardus Cagapistus, were appointed consuls
respectively five (1138–49) and 14 times (1141–1180). They were not just accomplished
legal experts, but skilled politicians whom the commune entrusted with very delicate
tasks and whose counsel was sought well beyond Milan. In 1154, Obertus and Gerardus
were chosen to represent the city before Frederick I at the diet of Roncaglia and to negotiate with him on behalf of the commune.23
Within this context, the exchange of fiefs was a significant means of sustaining the traditional political bonds between the military component of the urban elite and the archbishop, but now it served to a much larger extent to cement the clienteles of the military

elite. Along with this development, the fief started to be seen no longer as remuneration for
service but as property over which grantees of any social level had enforceable rights – a ius
in re.
24 In another way, however, fief-giving was still seen as a peculiar form of gift that
followed some basic rules and triggered reciprocal expectations. This practice of giftgiving had already undergone a good deal of institutionalisation by the time the
antiqua was composed. Some of its features are important for contextualising the
making of the LF in Milan. There is, in the first place, evidence of fiefs held of the
emperor: in 1140 Obertus himself judged a dispute about sovereignty over two Alpine
communities that were claimed as an imperial fief (feudum) by both the counts of
Seprio and the nobleman Locarnus de Besocio, of a powerful capitaneal family.25 The
majority of the fiefs that emerge in charters, however, derived from older archiepiscopal
grants. These grants concerned either shares of rural lordships or rights to collect tithes.
Archbishops had enfeoffed most of these resources, at once both important politically
and lucrative, mostly in 980–1035, to establish and sustain their political control over
Milan.26 Enrica Salvatori has shown how this worked out for two capitaneal families,
the de Porta Romana and de Porta Orientale, whose social distinction was mainly due
to the support, also military, they had offered to the archbishop. The former’s fief consisted
of lands and rights in several rural districts, but its core was the lordship over a castle
located just outside the gates of Milan (Villamaggiore) which allowed the family to
become part of the urban elite in the late eleventh century and fulfil a central role in
the communal institutions. The de Porta Orientale family, whose fief consisted mostly
of tithes in the Varese area, even though one of their members was elected archbishop
(Arnulf III, 1093–7), was never involved in urban government. In both cases, however,
fiefs had been treated as family assets, passed on to heirs, alienated to churches or subenfeoffed to followers, to the point that in the early twelfth century the two families
only held residual shares of them.27
That the same fief could be used at different social levels and hence trigger different
expectations and obligations emerges clearly from three charters from the archive of Morimondo Abbey. The capitanei de Besate and de Setara – very influential in the city – held a
fief from the archbishop which included land, tithes and most likely jurisdictional rights in
the parish of Coronate, not far from the territory of Pavia. The charters attest to the acquisition of this fief by the monks of Morimondo partly from the capitanei themselves, partly
from the people to whom these capitanei had sub-enfeoffed it. In the first charter, written
in Pavia (9 January 1137), one Lanfranc and his two sons, for £13 (of Pavia), leased in perpetuity to one of the monks of Morimondo all the land and tithes they held from their
lords (seniores) of the de Besate family. The same day, Wido de Besate renounced to
the abbot portions of the fief that he had sub-enfeoffed to two other men. One year
later, another Lanfranc, a capitaneus from the de Setara, a consul of Milan in 1145 and
1156, gave up a portion of the same fief, which he had sub-enfeoffed to a Milanese

never exercised government functions in Milan.

citizen.28 The fief that once had configured a political alliance between two noble families
and the archbishop was now used to build these noblemen’s clienteles in a relationship
overtly described as lordship.29 There is no direct evidence of how this specific lordship
worked in practice, but studies of Lombard rural communities confirm how such grants
contributed to the creation of hierarchy in rural societies, by according immunity from
a lord’s jurisdiction.30
Besides land, jurisdictional rights and the right to collect tithes, fiefs could also consist
of pecuniary (de camera) or in-kind (de caneva) incomes – fiefs-rente and warehouse-fiefs.
In 1131–3 the church of Velate, an area of the diocese of Varese politically subject to
Milan, performed at least five transactions to obtain the waiver of a fief de camera of at
least £2 10 solidi (of Milan) per annum – the original amount was certainly higher. The
charters mention explicitly that it was an archiepiscopal fief-rente originally granted to
the capitanei of the de Besocio family, who had divided it among heirs and subenfeoffed it to followers.31 The earliest warehouse fiefs appear in two different situations.
The first is a beneficium de caneva (1116) consisting of 16 modia (about 2340 litres) of rye
per annum held from the canons of Sant’Ambrogio by two Milanese citizens, probably
capitanei of the Grassi family, advocati of that church.32 The second one is a grant of
1137 (‘investivit per feudum’) by Musso de Concorezo, a powerful Milanese citizen, of
just 4 staria (about 73 litres) of rye and millet per annum, an amount that suggest this
was a sub-enfeoffment of a larger fief. The charter specifies that the grantee, another
inhabitant of Milan, could pass on the fief to both male and female heirs and that the
fief was granted in return for his oath of fidelity (‘debeat … facere fidelitatem suprascripto
Mussoni’).33
These cases outline some of the main features of fief-giving in central Lombardy during
the period when the first codification of the LF was made. Whatever their nature – lordships, lands or income in money or kind – fiefs were heritable resources; these grants were
usually intended to extend the political patronage of the grantor, whether a man or a
church, over the grantee and his descendants. They were exchanged, possibly subenfeoffed or sub-leased, at different social levels and thus they triggered different expectations, entitling the donor to services commensurate to the receiver’s status and
honour – holders of high status were expected to provide political backing and occasionally military aid with their men; peasant elites were instead presumed to guarantee good

estate management and serve as squires.34 Fiefs were conveyed through a public ritual of
investiture, perhaps in a way not so different from other types of transactions, after which
the recipient was generally required to take an oath of fidelity. These ‘feudal’ oaths did not
normally mention the provision of specific services but, in the context of the lay aristocracy, they certainly served to sustain aristocratic clienteles. This was all the more important if one considers that clienteles were a fundamental element in the blood feuds and
private wars which were used as a means to establish and exert power in twelfthcentury Italy.35
The making of the Libri feudorum
In light of all these elements, the texts of the antiqua can be reappraised as products of
a specific social and political context. The 1037 ordinance had sanctioned (or
confirmed) the heritability of archiepiscopal fiefs which, although fragmented, in the
early twelfth century remained a valuable tool in the hands of a military elite (capitanei
and valvasores) who constituted an important part of the urban ruling class and used
these fiefs as a means to cement their clientele. The rise of this elite and the decline of
the archbishop’s power are manifest in the latter’s gradual eclipse in the texts of the
antiqua. In the first section of the book (c.1100–20), the archbishop appears at the
top of an imagined hierarchy of tenures (LF 1.1). About 1150, however, Obertus did
not mention the archbishop in his tracts and when he set out the hierarchy of
tenures once more he placed the emperor (princeps) at its top (LF 2.10). This should
not induce us, however, to believe that Obertus was a champion of imperial authority.
Even though he was appointed missus imperialis by Lothair III and managed the
relationships between Milan and Frederick I, his letters rather seem to acknowledge
and support the increasing agency of the Milanese capitanei and valvasores. An early
tract (c.1100–20), following the letter of the 1037 ordinance, stated that fiefs granted
by high nobles (‘marchiones, comites et … capitanei’) ought to be forfeit only for
evident crimes whereas those fiefs granted by lesser or ‘the smallest’ valvasores might
be seised at the lord’s will; but its author added, not without a hint of bitterness,
‘the moderns [i.e. present-day writers], who do not distinguish so subtly, say that
what is said for the greater valvasores ought to be observed for the smallest valvasores.’
36 Obertus, in LF 2.10, held that this was common practice in the Milanese
courts, but felt it necessary to draw a boundary between the traditional aristocracy
and these newcomers by pointing out that ‘they who do not hold a benefice from
long ago, although they recently acquired it from the capitanei or valvasores, are nonetheless commoners (plebeii).’

prompting, the decline of archiepiscopal authority and the increased agency of the
Milanese elite. Obertus, in particular, was a protagonist in the political life of Milan,
part of a restricted group of legal experts who ran the highest civic court and shared
the rule of the city with the same military aristocracy which he liked to depict as a
closed social group.38
It has been argued that these early texts are ‘not actually very close to what the 1037
ordinance had said’ and that they were the outcome of scholarly discussions.39 But our
evidence shows that they may be better envisaged as formulations by interested actors
directly involved in the developments of their society. Divergence of opinion seems not
to reflect different intellectual views about the text of the ordinance, more than that it is
a manifestation of the variety of practice in different places, times and social levels – as
we have seen in our examples. This appears in the treatment of succession and obligations.
Whereas Ugo de Gambolado (writing before 1136) thought that fiefs consisting of counties, marquisates or other high imperial offices ought not to be heritable (LF 1.13), and
another early author implied likewise (LF 1.1), a third one, perhaps commenting on
Ugo’s passage, admitted that ‘no succession lies in a fief of a county, a marquisate or
any other high offices according to reasonable usage, but today this [succession] is
taken into use (usurpatum).’
40 As we have seen, the bulk of the Milanese fiefs were
subject to partible inheritance. All the authors of the antiqua acknowledged this principle
(LF 1.1, 8, 13, 18, 24; 2.11). A notable exception was the exclusion of daughters: in one
passage it was made clear that this exclusion was allegedly due to helplessness of
females to raise feuds or wage war.41 Succession to daughters, however, was allowed if
it was agreed between grantor and grantee, on the condition that no other male heir
was left (LF 1.8.1, 1.14), no matter if, as Obertus admitted, such an agreement was
against the ‘custom of fiefs’.
42 These elements explain why the clause allowing succession
to daughters was generally inserted in infeudations of minor portions of revenues (as in
our 1137 example) and not of entire lordships or castles, which implicitly required the
receiver to be able to exert coercive power or possess military skills.
Probably because mutual obligations often remained unspoken, encoded within the
reciprocal status of the parties, the authors of the LF decided not to commit themselves
to any strict definition. The earliest tracts provide generic mentions of serving (servire)
and refer the matter to the specific promises sworn in the oaths (pacta or sacramenta),
which were deemed binding and could over-ride nearly any principle governing the
customs of fiefs – as we have now seen in the succession to daughters. Chapters on
how a fief ought to be forfeit mainly express ‘negative’ obligations – not to serve the

lord (LF 1.20); not to wound him or besiege his castle; not to sleep with his wife nor harass
her; not to kill the lord’s closest relatives; not to reveal to anyone his secrets to his detriment (LF 1.5, 16). The only positive obligation is to support the lord on the battlefield, but
this is subsumed in another negative obligation: not to abandon him in the field if he is not
yet dead.43 Obertus, in an attempt to define fiefs in more precise terms, rephrased Seneca
by defining the beneficium as ‘a well-intentioned action that confers joy on the receivers
and in so doing, the receiver, who is well inclined and willingly prepared for what he
does, confers joy’.
44 He continued:
Within this category (genus) of actions, there is one that is given out of someone’s benevolence so that the ownership of an immovable good that is given as a beneficium remains in the
hands of the giver, while its usufruct is transferred to the receiver in a way that it will belong
to him and his heirs … in perpetuity, and thereby he and his heirs ought to serve the lord
faithfully, whether it is explicitly expressed what the service (servitium) should be, or it is
promised indeterminately.45
Obertus thus admitted that the servitium could be either explicit or implicit, although he
added that ‘there is no more just cause to take away a benefice than when [a vassal] refuses
to provide the service in return for which the benefice is given.’
46 Indeed, rather than
offering a taxonomy of all the possible services or promises of services that often remained
implicit, he and the authors of the LF opted for creating a supple framework into which it
was possible to fit actual cases – a framework that was informed by thorough awareness.
This is all the more evident in the progressive Romanisation of feudal law in which
Obertus was a leading actor and which developed in the mid twelfth century. The
process was closely related to the increasing use of legal actions derived from Romanocanonical procedure in the Milanese judicial system. This shift induced plaintiffs,
lawyers and notaries to define possession in more precise terms both in the formulation
of complaints and in the compilation of charters to be used as proof in court.47
This transition is evident both in Obertus’ letters and in the texts that were added to the
antiqua throughout the second half of the twelfth century. The letters convey greater precision in terminology than the earlier texts and an explicit, though rudimentary, use of
Roman law notions.48 At the start of the first, Obertus declared that Milanese disputes
were ‘solved by either Roman law, Lombard law or the custom of the kingdom’ (LF
2.1). In the following statement, a subject of much debate, he inverted the wording and
the meaning of a famous rescript by Constantine, transmitted through the Codex,
43 LF 1.5: ‘Si enim dominus praelium campestre habuerit et vasallus eum morantem in ipso praelio dimiserit non
mortuum, non ad mortem vulneratum, feudum amittere debet.’ 44 LF 2.23: ‘Beneficium nihil quam benevola actio tribuens gaudium capientibus capiensque tribuendo in id quod facit
prona et sponte sua parata.’ See Seneca, On Benefits, trans. Miriam Griffin and Brad Inwood (Chicago: University of
Chicago Press, 2011), 24.
45 LF 2.23: ‘Huius autem generis species quaedam est beneficium illud quod ex benevolentia alicuius ita datur ut proprietate quidem rei immobilis beneficiatae penes dantem remanente, ususfructus illius rei ita ad accipientem transeat
ut ad eum heredesque suos masculos sive feminas, si de his nominatim dictum sit, in perpetuum pertineat ob hoc ut ille
et sui heredes fideliter domino serviant, sive servitium illud nominatim quale esse debeat sit expressum, sive indeterminate sit promissum.’ 46 LF 2.24.6: ‘Sed non est alia iustior causa beneficii auferendi quam si id pro quo beneficium datum fuerit hoc servitium facere recusaverit, quia beneficium amittit.’ 47 Magnus Ryan, ‘Ius commune feudorum in the Thirteenth Century’, in ‘ … Colendo iustitiam et iura condendo … ’:

which sanctioned the supremacy of law over custom and long established uses. Obertus
noted that in disputes concerning fiefs ‘the authority of the Roman laws is not negligible,
but it does not extend its force so far as to over-ride usage and practice (mores).’
49
A new procedure based on ancient Roman legal actions had by then become predominant in the Milanese courts. Plaintiffs were required to present their claims according to
certain formulae which would then induce the judge to take specific ‘actions’ to conclude
the case. Most aspects of fief-giving and fief-holding, however, were alien to the Roman law
tradition and had no precedent in the Corpus iuris civilis, which made it difficult to specify
claims on fiefs in an effective way. Lawyers, therefore, had to proceed by analogy, and
Roman law provided cutting-edge tools for this. It was only at this stage that a specific
aspect of fief-giving was framed in terms of property law. Obertus was the first lawyer
to define fiefs in terms of ius in re. He tells us that fiefs were things (res) whose possession
could be defended against unlawful occupants by asking the judge to enforce restitution by
means of an action known as the rei vindicatio, a claim that, according to Roman law, was
allowed to full owners only.50 More precisely, he held that a vassal could bring an action
analogous to the vindicatio (‘possit … quasi vindicare’) as if he were the owner (‘tanquam
dominus’).51 This categorisation was reformulated in more precise terms later in the
twelfth century, and not in Milan. Here it is only necessary to demonstrate how
Obertus stretched the notion of res to fit the varied nature of resources that he saw
enfeoffed: a fief, he wrote, may consist of a piece of land (res soli), things attached to
land (res solo coherentes) such as buildings and crops, or ‘what can be reckoned as immovable things’ (‘quae inter immobilia computantur’) (LF 2.1.1). The last category, he
explained, also included the fiefs de camera and de caneva, annual payments of pecuniary
or in-kind revenues that were generally held by persons of non-noble status.
This formalisation, however, informed by a rudimentary knowledge of Roman law, was
not an academic exercise unconcerned with social practice. It stemmed directly from practical problems and was aimed at solving them within a precise institutional setting. It
attests to a regularisation of the treatment of the possessory implications of fief-giving
in the new procedures followed in the Milanese courts. The later recensions of the LF
confirm the ways in which the treatment of feudal disputes in court became increasingly
entwined with these procedures in a changed political landscape. The inclusion in the law
book of legal opinions given by Milanese consuls and deliberations of the city council, as
well as more than 40 examples of textual convergence between Obertus’ and post-Obertine
texts on the one hand, and the Liber consuetudinum Mediolani (Book of customs of Milan)
of 1216 on the other, stand as evidence of this.52

The literature associated with the Libri feudorum
The most noticeable effect of the Romanisation of feudal law was an emphasis on the
tenurial aspects of fiefs – an attempt to regularise their treatment within known categories
of property law. If issues emerging from practice had played a fundamental role in shaping
the texts of the LF, they nonetheless continued to compel later lawyers to reinterpret a
variety of shifting characteristics of fief-giving in different times and contexts. These
efforts did not build only on the interpretation of the fief as ius in re. They also tackled
matters that were not directly connected with property law, such as personal obligations
and service, that continued to stir up issues in practice and court, as well as debates among
lawyers. Although the definition of the fief as ius in re was of great importance for later
articulations of power, as the case of Pillius will show, it is far from representing a comprehensive definition of the entire set of practices of fief-giving. It rather suggests that the
tenurial aspect was the most likely to give rise to litigation – not a surprising fact if one
considers the volume of exchange and fragmentation of fiefs. The following sections
turn to the circular relationship between practice and legal theory, to the ways in which
some practical aspects of fiefs could shape legal theory and how theory might then be
re-contextualised in different settings.
Glossae and quaestiones by Pillius de Medicina in Modena
Pillius de Medicina (d. c.1212) was one of the most talented and innovative lawyers of his
time.53 A professor in Roman law at Bologna, he moved about 1180 to a new law school
founded in Modena, where he used the LF as a text book for the first time in its history,
implicitly admitting it alongside the traditional texts of Roman law – Justinian’s Code, the
Digest, Institutes and Novels. Pillius’ teaching based on the LF has come down to us as a
commentary in a version heavily reworked by later scholarship, and an apparatus of
glossae that created a standard reference tool for future teaching and interpretation of
the LF.54 The importance of this apparatus in terms of legal doctrine cannot be stressed
enough: by building a first, structured system of connections between the LF and the
Roman law texts, Pillius ‘opened the path for the Libri feudorum to be quoted by the glossators, and within a few decades to make their triumphal entry in the standard version of
the Corpus iuris civilis’.
55
One of the major accomplishments attributed to this apparatus is the formalisation of
the notion of ‘double ownership’, one of the most successful legal devices to frame fiefagainst nearly all previous [opinions], have in some cases recently established, and all the Milanese have agreed and
now agree with this decision, that a certified charter shall suffice as proof of a new investiture, even if it is not confirmed
by [the grantee’s] peers but by others’;‘Consules tamen Mediolanenses nuper quibusdam omnia contra rescripserunt in
quo fere omnes Mediolanenses consenserunt et consentiunt ut breve testatum non a paribus sed ab aliis confirmatum
sufficiat ad probandam novam investituram.’ 53 Ennio Cortese, ‘Pillio da Medicina’, Dizionario biografico dei giuristi italiani, vol. 2: 1587–90; Emanuele Conte, ‘Pillio

holding in later centuries.56 While working for the commune of Modena, Pillius, like
Obertus, was concerned with formulating a connection between a holder’s claim on the
possession of a fief and a proper legal action that could be accepted in the civic courts.
The question was: if the vassal can act as an owner of a fief, how can we distinguish his
ownership from that of the lord who granted it? The solution he proposed was a distinction between two types of ownership: the dominium directum retained by the lord and the
dominium utile transferred to the fief-holder. While acknowledging a separation and a
hierarchy of ownership, this distinction solved an urgent problem: since in practice a
lord and a fief-holder held different rights of real property in the same thing, it was not
possible to allow them the same legal action in court. The subtlety was to resort to the
notion of utilitas, which in ancient Roman law was used to connect by analogy rights
and claims that were not covered by existing law (in this case, rights and claims relating
to fief-holding) to known standard formulae – the rights of direct owners and the legal
actions available to them. Obertus had already suggested in elementary terms that the
vassal could quasi vindicare the possession of a fief; Pillius devised a more refined solution:
by virtue of his dominium directum, a lord could use a rei vindicatio directa while the fiefholder could use a rei vindicatio utilis.
This fundamental distinction appears in two glossae: ‘rebus suis’ (LF 2.3) and ‘vindicare’
(LF 2.8.1). The former tackles the question of whether an heir who is forbidden to alienate
an inheritance may enfeoff it; it represents the earliest description of fief-giving as a form
of transfer of dominium utile.
57 In the second glossa, Pillius affirms that since the vindicatio utilis is allowed for any perpetual or long-term lease of land, ‘even more so it is commonly allowed (concedi solet) to a fief-holder’.
58 Pillius was facing a fundamental issue that
had already been addressed by Obertus: how to define rights and claims relating to practices that had no precedent in Roman law in order to regularise their treatment within the
Romano-canonical procedure adopted by the city-communes, in particular in Modena,
where he lived and taught. One important document outlines the context in which
Pillius came to formulate this theory.59 In October 1182, a dispute was settled between
the commune of Modena and several great prelates, including the bishop: an earlier
municipal statute had allowed long-term lessees and fief-holders of the main Modenese
churches to alienate the tenures located in the city or in its surroundings. Under this
statute, holders were permitted to alienate these tenures in any way except sale, even
without the lord’s approval; any earlier sub-lease or sub-enfeoffment of these tenures
was confirmed; lords were prevented from recovering them even when holders died

Cum ergo utilis vindicatio supradictis concedatur, multo fortius feudatario concedi solet.’ It is possible that he had in mind Obertus’ text when he wrote
‘concedi solet’; the point made by the Milanese lawyer, however, differed from the one made in this glossa in that
Obertus had not discussed the vindicatio utilis directly and had not tried to associate fiefs by analogy with other
tenures.

without heirs, to the benefit of sub-tenants.60 This means that the rights of long-term
lessees and fief-holders had been de facto acknowledged as very similar, yet not identical,
to those of lessors and grantors. This is precisely the situation that Pillius had in mind in
his glossa ‘vindicare’ when he suggested that all these holders could bring a vindicatio
utilis. He framed a contingent configuration of socio-political relationships within a
precise legal notion. The creation of one of the most important distinctions in the
history of the law of real property was shaped by tangible, practical issues.
Ardizone and the Summa feudorum
A very similar approach to practice is recognisable in the treatment of personal obligation
and service by Iacobus de Ardizone, one of the most cited authors in feudal law. A member
of a leading Veronese family of bankers and legal experts, Ardizone studied law at Bologna
in 1224–8 and worked as a public official and legal expert in Verona around 1229–54.61 At
this time in Verona, urban and rural institutions were intimately connected, and it was not
uncommon to find notaries from the contado working at the communal palace or urban
judges attending seigniorial courts.62 On 2 January 1230, a young Ardizone counselled the
prior of the canons regular of S. Giorgio in Braida, a suburban church of Verona, in the
seigniorial court held in the village of Sabbion. The community was dominated by a group
of fief-holders of the church, whose fiefs were tax-free farms (mansi) and shares of
seigniorial incomes held in exchange for the annual render of a horse. Although, in
theory, fief-holding distinguished local elites from lesser villagers who were subject to
heavy taxation and demeaning services, marriage practices blurred social distinctions.
The trade in land and partible inheritance, furthermore, led to the fragmentation of
these small fiefs among male successors, generation after generation.63
When disputes about these fragmented fiefs arose among holders, they first tried to
settle them by private arbitration or by force; only as a last resort were the cases
brought before their lords, the canons of S. Giorgio. On the other hand, disputes
between lords and their fief-holders were usually judged by the latter’s peers – peers
only in theory since S. Giorgio’s vassals encompassed powerful capitanei as well as
urban nobles, lesser knights and squires.64 In the early thirteenth century, however,
when the jurisdiction of the commune of Verona over the entire contado was unchallenged, the city courts became a regular place for setting disputes even in a small rural

prepare a written description of the entire family fief, which consisted of both land and
shares of seigniorial income. In a shrewd attempt to avoid providing services, or
perhaps to buy time and thus delay the lords’ inquiry, he produced a complicated document which the canons struggled to interpret. The case reappeared on 14 February 1229 in
the city court before the judge and consul Martinus da Cerea, where the parties exchanged
opposing statements about the length of time Aimo and his family had failed to provide a
horse in return for their fief – S. Giorgio’s attorney maintained it had been five years,
whereas Aimo stated that it had been only three.65
The case was discussed at the seigniorial court held in Sabbion before Ardizone just a
few months later, in January 1230. It has recently been demonstrated that the manuscripts
of Ardizone’s Summa feudorum transmit different versions of the treatise: a first incomplete draft was circulated soon after he came back from Bologna, about 1229–30,
whereas at least two extended and updated versions appeared after 1234.66 In the extended
versions, Ardizone added a considerable number of references to local practices labelled as
‘the custom of Verona’ (consuetudo Veronensis). One of these additions dealt with horsefiefs:
One may say that, by custom (consuetudine), when there is mention of horse service, the
vassal ought to keep a horse and offer it to his lord at his will. … The application (usus)
[of this custom] in Verona is that … the vassal ought to provide a horse of medium size.
… Should the horse die accidentally during the service, by the custom of Verona the
vassal ought to buy a new one after five years. Even though some courts hold [that this
should happen] after seven or eight years, here we prefer to retain it as five, as it is counselled
by experts (a prudentibus consultum).67
The chapter describes a particular usus and consuetudo of Verona and frames it within
a more general customary rule according to which the verbal agreement about the provision of a horse was binding on fief-holders. Indeed, the offering of horses as a service
in return for fiefs seems to belong to a broader and shared repertoire of models available to lords in different regions of medieval Europe.68 Ardizone was perhaps aware of
it, but he certainly derived particular details of this customary rule from direct observation. The connection between Aimo’s case and Ardizone’s argument could not be
clearer, and in light of the latter, we can understand how, by urging Aimo to admit
that he failed to provide a horse for five consecutive years, the canons aimed at obtaining service immediately. It is even possible that the municipal official who judged
Aimo’s case was one of the prudentes to whose judgement Ardizone referred in the
summa.
Obertus had already acknowledged the binding force of verbal agreements on the
matter of service, even though he did not pronounce on its content, the entire matter

remaining mostly outside written tradition. Ardizone was concerned with the validity of
such verbal agreements and their binding force. He made clear in his summa that unwritten norms had the same value as written ones and the LF was no exception. The ‘custom of
fief’, he wrote, was contained only partially in the LF and did not necessarily acquire
greater authority from the mere fact of being written down. On the contrary, unwritten
custom had its own intrinsic legal force.69
Jean Blanc of Marseilles and the Provençal context
Pillius and Ardizone were the first glossators to produce structured arguments based on
the LF.70 It is useful to follow how these arguments were received and possibly reused
in different geographical settings. By 1237, a young scholar from Marseilles, Jean Blanc,
had concluded his legal studies at Modena; he went back to Provence, taking with him
a copy of Ardizone’s Summa. Here he built a successful career as a private legal counsellor
and a diplomat for the commune of Marseilles (1241–1263), Charles I d’Anjou and King
James I of Aragon, for whom he received the oaths of fidelity of the crown’s vassals.71 In
1260 he wrote an Epitome feudorum, the first work based on the LF written on the other
side of the Alps, which was evidently inspired by Ardizone’s Summa. Blanc copied entire
chapters of the Italian treatise, including some passages dealing with the ‘Veronese
customs’. Quite remarkably, however, he sometimes omitted the adjective ‘Veronese’: in
this way, arguments initially shaped by local usage came to describe what eventually
seemed like general norms.72
To provide a possible explanation for this process, it is helpful to understand how
Blanc’s work related to the teaching of law at Modena, in particular the disputations –
one of the most widespread teaching methods – introduced by Pillius decades earlier.
In a disputatio, students were divided into two groups, which had to deploy opposing
arguments pro and contra a given case. The written outcomes of such disputations,
called quaestiones disputatae, were then used as teaching material and Pillius’ collection
quickly became a standard for this genre.73 The Epitome reveals how Blanc was heavily
influenced not only by the pattern of reasoning underlying these exercises, but also by
specific quaestiones he had learned in Modena. In many arguments, his method was to
start from a quaestio he knew, derive a principle from it, and produce new quaestiones
by applying that principle to cases he observed in practice. The transmutation of local
usage into general principles seems to have followed the same logic. As a result, the
Epitome appears as a mixture of teachings and readings received in Italy, implemented

Bordeaux 2 (1978): 72. The examples emerging from direct observation are the most numerous I could find in a treatise
on fiefs; Ardizone’s treatise has the second greatest number of examples. The cases concern the Templars, the counts of
Provence, Cistercian abbeys and several local churches, all mentioned in quaestiones de facto: Jean Blanc, Epitome iuris

through practical knowledge accumulated in Provence, all painted onto the canvas of
Ardizone’s Summa.
A practical example of how this process of abstraction and reuse of legal knowledge
worked in Blanc’s case illuminates the unsettled dialectics of law and practice. In 1186,
the bishop of Ferrara enfeoffed to the local capitaneus Taurellus a number of villages
and castles in the region around Ferrara. The jurisdiction over one of these castles,
Massa, a small centre on the River Po, was soon disputed and the case was concluded
only in 1204.74 The matter drew the attention of Pillius, who set up a quaestio using
these actors and places – the bishop of Ferrara, Taurellus and Massa – asking his pupils
whether jurisdiction was granted together with the enfeoffment of the castle. To avoid
his students becoming distracted by unfamiliar elements and to focus on the crucial
points of the argument, Pillius substituted fictional actors for the real ones – with the
bishop of Modena enfeoffing Bazzano, a castle not far from Modena, to ‘someone’.
75
Blanc’s Epitome reports this quaestio and supplements it with the opinion of Blanc’s
master, Homobonus, omitting all references to specific actors, whether real or fictional.76
These intentional omissions – whether of the adjective Veronensis or a quaestio’s real
actors – unveil a fundamental mechanism in the construction of the glossators’ legal
culture. To some degree, the regularisation of procedures and the nature of the teaching
methods drove the abstraction of cases and social facts. The translation of social norms
and strategies into written traditions often came at the cost of changing their nature, to
adapt them to the encoded system that jurists were building, a process of continuous
decontextualisation and recontextualisation.77 On the one hand, scholastic methods
invited lawyers to focus on questions rather than on answers – and thus on how to
argue cases rather than to seek or provide rigid solutions – and to connect species to
genera, specific cases to general principles. On the other hand, these methods provided
a solution for a strictly practical issue: to provide an audience of students and practitioners
with tools to be used in the judicial arena. The logic underlying both contexts required
legal arguments to be exposed in their purity. All the superfluous details, the potentially
distracting background noise, had to be removed. Such mechanisms were evident to
thirteenth-century lawyers, but in many cases later interpreters failed to understand the
historical roots of legal arguments precisely because of them.
Once a species was connected to its genus, the logic informing the connection could be
applied to different arguments and realities. In fact, the trajectory of Pillius’ quaestio did
not end with its inclusion in Blanc’s Epitome. To determine whether jurisdiction was
granted together with the castle, Pillius answered that one ought to conform to whatever
the verbal agreement between the parties had set out (‘quid actum fuit inter eos, ut illud
servetur’); should this point not be clear, the judge ought to consider the parties’ relative
status and the size of the fief – one of the features of fief-giving we have observed in Milan.
Blanc, following Homobonus, dissented: jurisdiction did come together with a castle,
especially when there was no explicit agreement on the matter for ‘what is not explicitly

excepted is openly granted.’
78 This is exactly the argument Blanc applied to a famous case
he attended in the 1240s, between the bishop of Apt and the nobleman Bertrand Rainaud
of Agoult-Simiane, concerning jurisdiction over the men of Simiane. The bishop had
received Simiane’s donjon by imperial grant and was trying to recover the possession of
the castle and the rights that belonged to it, long held by Bertrand’s family.79 Blanc
favoured the bishop’s claim by resorting to a bodily analogy: he played on the fact that
the infeudation concerned the donjon – in Latin, caput castri, the ‘head of the castle’.
Since the head is useless without limbs, the grant of the former should always imply the
grant of the latter; thus, when the emperor granted the bishop of Apt the castle’s head,
the inclusion of the rest of the castle, its appurtenances, and hence the jurisdiction over
its district, was implicit in the infeudation.80
Feudal law without the Libri feudorum?
The Simiane case not only provides a thought-provoking insight into the complicated twoway relationship between practice and law, it also offers some details that allow us to reappraise the practical use of the LF further. The dispute concluded on 24 March 1247 with
Bertrand’s oath of fidelity and homage to the bishop. The charter suggests that the oath
reproduced that contained in a much studied letter of c.1020, in which Fulbert of Chartres
described to Duke William V of Aquitaine the duties of a fidelis toward his lord.81 The
letter was included in the LF (2.6: De forma fidelitatis) and by the 1220s had become
the principal formula for feudal oaths in the French Midi. It has been argued that its widespread use was a consequence of its inclusion in the LF, which is believed to have had the
force of law in the Midi. The arguments in favour of this hypothesis, however, are not fully
convincing. They rest on the assumption that feudal cases could be resolved only by rules
derived from an established corpus of feudal law, that is, the LF, and the evidence has then
been forced to fit this mould and, in turn, to reinforce this assumption.82
The circumstances of the inclusion of Fulbert’s letter in the LF suggest that it is very
unlikely that the oath was derived from this book in the 1220s. It is well known that Fulbert’s letter circulated in canon law compilations, including Gratian’s Decretum. All extant
manuscripts of the LF dating to the early and mid thirteenth century, as well as Ardizone’s

Summa, present the letter not as a part of the book, but as an extravagans, one of the texts
recurrently copied as an appendix to it.83 In the vulgata version of the LF (c.1250), the
opening of the letter states its position in the Decretum (LF 2.7: ‘in decretis causa
XXII’), and both Odofredus (c.1240) and Blanc (c.1260) envisaged it as part of the same
canon law collection.84 Before then, the content of the letter and its application to
feudal cases had already been the subject of commentary by canonists such as Huguccio
(d. 1210) and Tancred (d. c.1236).85 The use of this formula in feudal oaths, therefore, does
not prove the statutory force of the LF in the Midi. It might prove – though the matter
should be investigated further – the influence of canonists on the formulation of feudal
oaths and feudal relationships. This hypothesis might find support in studies suggesting
that fief-holding was widespread in Provence as a compromise to protect ecclesiastical
land – a means devised by lawyers to convert into fiefs the tenures usurped by local
nobles.86 Be that as it may, there is no direct proof, besides the circulation of Fulbert’s
letter, of any use of the LF in Provençal practice until the 1260s.87
It has also been argued that references to ‘double possession’ and ‘double ownership’
would be indirect proofs of the influence of the LF, but both arguments seem weak.
The distinction between possessio civilis and possessio naturalis – that is, possession
justified by a lawful title and possession de facto, without legal grounds ‒ appears in archival records from 1224 onwards. This notion, however, does not derive from the LF and
there is no reason why we should take for granted that its source was Pillius’ Summa feudorum – a work whose authorship is much in doubt.88 After all, the acknowledgement of
possessio civilis to fief-holders might already have been envisaged by Rogerius, who taught
in Provence in the mid twelfth century. This position was rejected by orthodox legal
opinion in Bologna, embodied by Iohannes Bassianus and his pupil Azo, who only
acknowledged that fief-holders might have possessio naturalis.
89 The notion of duplex
dominium could have reached Provence through Pillius’ apparatus to the LF. Its first
occurrence is in a donation of 1227, with no reference to fiefs though.90 It re-emerges
in relation to fiefs only in 1235, in a notarial formulary compiled in Avignon.91 Even if

In considering an act of homage made in 1234 ‘prout jura canonica et civilia intelligunt et exponunt’, the author holds
that ‘les Libri feudorum sont donc bien la référence et non le Décret, malgré une antériorité toute de circonstance.’ This
statement is contradicted by note 131: ‘Mais des renvois explicites aux Libri ou plutôt, comme les appellent les textes de
l’époque, aux Constitutiones feudorum ne se rencontrent à Marseille qu’en 1262.’ Expressions such as ‘in iure’ (1226)
and ‘iura … civilia’ (1234) do not support the idea that scribal practice was directly influenced by the LF, as Giordanengo implies.

this is reasonable proof of the circulation of commentaries on the LF in the Midi, it is far
from demonstrating that the LF was an authoritative source of law. Rather, it attests to the
lawyers’ need to frame in legal terms resources called fiefs, which entailed the transfer of
power and over which grantors and grantees maintained, or aimed at maintaining, specific
rights. In particular, they had to find solutions that could be accepted as part of new procedures, and while looking for these solutions they met with the same problems we have
observed in the examples from Milan and Modena.
Lawyers could frame different aspects of fiefs – ius in re, service, oath – by interpreting
practice through the lens of Roman law and canon law. From 1250 onwards, after the
inclusion of the LF in the Corpus iuris civilis, French lawyers gradually accepted the authority of this book as a source of law. Although they might have found the LF useful
in developing legal arguments about fiefs, they nonetheless tended to deny it statutory
force in practice. In 1256, Jean de Blanot, the famous Burgundian lawyer, educated in
Bologna, distinguished between the consuetudo feudorum contained in the LF, which he
scarcely mentioned, and the customs of the kingdom of France or other regions, including
Burgundy, which to him were the real authoritative custom.92 A century later, the lawyer
Petrus Jacobi, from Aurillac in the Auvergne and a teacher in Montpellier, whilst he
acknowledged the LF as a text that was useful in developing legal arguments, he
deemed it, from the first to the last line, as inapplicable in French territory, where disputes
about fiefs were determined by local customs which lawyers framed within Roman law
categories.93
The situation was undoubtedly different in Italy, but not so much as one might imagine.
Lawyers and court practitioners framed matters relating to fiefs within Roman law categories before the LF became the subject of interpretation by jurists.94 Two surviving
feudal quaestiones by Bulgarus (d. 1166) specified what legal actions were or were not
available in disputes over fiefs, tackling once again the strictly practical problem of how
to fit such cases into court procedure.95 When a court practitioner asked John Bassianus
(d. 1197) to provide a consilium about a dispute over a fief, the former was perfectly
capable of framing the case within a set of detailed Roman law arguments, without resorting to the LF.96 Pillius himself constructed all his quaestiones on fiefs relying on Roman
law alone, citing the LF but once.97 Similarly, Roffredus Beneventanus, in the early
1230s, described procedure in feudal cases through Roman law actiones, without
mention of the LF.98 The interest of canonists in feudal tenures and oaths also preceded
92 Jean Acher, ‘Notes sur le droit savant au moyen âge’, Revue Historique de Droit Français et Étranger 30 (1906):
138–78. In his tract De homagiis – an excerpt from a wider treatise on legal actiones ‒ Blanot separates the consuetudo
feudi from the consuetudines diversarum regionum (170–1), and the vulgare regni Franciae (168). 93 Petrus Jacobi de Aureliaco, Aurea practica libellorum (Cologne: Apud Geruinum Calenium, & hæredes Quentelios,

their utilisation of the LF: when they first discussed the section ‒ or title – concerning fiefs
that was inserted in the collections of papal decretals, they rarely mentioned the book,99
and they came to use and cite it systematically only in the late thirteenth century.100
These contexts all suggest that the influence of the LF on legal practice needs a thorough
reappraisal. Despite the dramatic increase of explicit citations of Roman law in charters,
there is no clear evidence for any direct use of the LF in scribal practice in this period.
When litigants, scribes or attorneys thought it useful to resort to a sense of authority in
the regulation of fiefs, they referred to either usage held in local courts (usus curiae) or
the ‘custom of the kingdom’. From the late twelfth century onwards, the latter expression
was often replaced by a more technical usus or ius feudi.
101 These notions, however, very
often covered matters that were not treated by the LF at all. While the LF slowly became a
source of authority for jurists in constructing their arguments, it was itself an incomplete
and historically determined expression of a broader and changing repertoire of models,
norms and potentially normative practices that underpinned the day-to-day exchange
of fiefs and services. All the cases examined in this article show, to different extents,
how similar practices of fief-giving and fief-holding developed independently of the availability of the LF and written law in general. Lords – whether lay or ecclesiastical, integrated
into civic government or isolated in their rural castles – did not seem to need the LF to
understand what a fief was. On the contrary, these shifting practices and strategies of
fief-giving could influence – sometimes even shape – the early learned law of fiefs to an
extent larger than the learned law seems to have been able at first to influence them.
Bringing the feudal law back home
The alleged disjuncture between practice and learned law ought not to be either an obstacle
to our interpretation of medieval societies or a source of mistrust in the learned law. It
should rather be an encouragement to reappraise our interpretation of the role of practice
both in the creation of learned law and the making of scholarly traditions. The historical
value of the LF is at once augmented and reduced. The book increasingly stimulated the
attention of learned lawyers and from the late thirteenth century onwards it came to be
known by scholars across Europe. Nonetheless, the slow development of this process and
the limited influence of the LF on scribal practice require a re-examination of the part
the book played in shaping the learned vocabulary of fiefs. Classic models of feudalism
have gone too far in their insistence on interpreting its institutions as the embodiment of
military values shared across medieval society: the evidence analysed in this article
99 The Summa titulorum by Ambrose (d. c.1215), for instance, cites Frederick I’s constitution Imperialem as a standalone piece of law, and not as part of the LF (2.54): Stephan Kuttner, Repertorium der Kanonistik (1140–1234), vol. 1,
Prodromus corporis glossarum (Vatican City: Biblioteca Apostolica, 1937), 392. These results are incomplete, however,
and the use of the LF in the canonist tradition needs a more thorough investigation.

confirms this overemphasis. It may also be true that modern interpretations of medieval
societies as ‘feudal’ have been led, either directly or indirectly, by notions and terms contained in the LF. The arguments set out here, however, cast reasonable doubt on the fact
that a high medieval academic milieu was the source for this. Fiefs and the logic that
informed their exchange did not need learned or professional law to exist in the real world.
This reappraisal of the creation of the learned law of fiefs has demonstrated some aspects
of the nature of legal work and writing, its uses and modalities – in other terms, its practical
nature and hence its intellectual dimensions. As scholars trained in scholastic methods, the
authors commenting upon the LF often argued about the law’s subtleties, but they never lost
sight of the practical purpose of their activity. They were primarily concerned with two
orders of problem: shaping legal devices with the tools available to them to fit the practices
of fief-giving in the new Romanised legal procedure; and providing their audience with adequate legal training. They were less focused on creating substantive, abstract rules for fiefholding: they were more interested in posing new questions and elaborating sets of arguments pro and contra to be used in the judicial arena to defend any claim – or the opposing
counterclaim. From this perspective, it is the more apparent that notions related to fiefs and
vassals were not the by-product of a scholarly tradition.
If daily practice continued to exert influence on learned lawyers, in a more or less direct
way which it is sometimes possible to trace, it seems insufficient to insist only on theoretical analyses of fiefs as the way in which the law of property was shaped. It might be
equally fruitful to investigate the shifting values and models underlying bonds of patronage in communities that were undergoing processes of bureaucratisation and the centralisation of power. For that analysis, we must look beyond the aristocratic elites and the
evidence connected to them – which has thus far been the main focus of attention. To
bring the feudal law back home, we need to include in the picture a broader range of
actors – lesser clienteles, castellans, rural knights, peasant elites, ministeriales – all the forgotten agents in the historians’ arguments pro and contra feudalism.</p>

as Equal Opportunity

Abstract: Many supporters of open borders argue that restrictions on
immigration are unjust in part because they undermine equal opportunity. Borders prevent the globally least-advantaged from pursuing
desirable opportunities abroad, cementing arbitrary facts about birth and
citizenship. In this paper I advance an argument from equal opportunity
to global freedom of movement. In addition to preventing people from
pursuing desirable opportunities, borders also create a prone, segregated
population that can be dominated and exploited. Restrictions on mobility
do not just trap people in bad opportunity sets—they help create bad
opportunities by isolating the negative externalities of production and
foreign policy. Freedom of movement can play a vital role in spreading
risks and burdens, incentivizing their mitigation. Using an analysis of
feudalism, segregation, and the transnational economy, I illustrate the
centrality of space and mobility, showing why freedom of movement
is a necessary tool for preventing political and economic oppression.
Introduction1
Equality of opportunity (EO) has become a major fulcrum in the debate
over immigration. Joseph Carens has led the push for more open borders, arguing that restrictions on mobility create unjust divisions in life
prospects, thereby violating a global principle of EO.2
 In response, critics
have argued that Carens misunderstands the value of EO, ignoring salient differences between the domestic and global practices.

In this paper I seek to vindicate Carens’s conclusion, putting it on
firmer ground within liberal political philosophy. In order to do so I offer
an extended analysis of EO. The goal of EO is not simply eliminating the
effects of luck on life chances. Instead, I argue that securing EO spreads
risks and negative externalities across those participating in, and affected
by, an economic practice.
John Rawls identified two ways that opportunities might be unequal:
1) discrimination preventing people from getting positions for which they
are qualified and 2) unequal education and training leaving people without the ability to develop their talents. When opportunities are unequal
in these ways, socioeconomic positions become inherited. This has two
implications. First, it unjustly precludes people—on the basis of group
membership—from enjoying the benefits of a system of cooperation.
Second, when people in the worst positions are segregated based on
group membership, there is little incentive to improve their pay, workplace conditions, or benefits. Roosevelt’s New Deal was tailored to exclude southern Black workers by excluding the jobs in sectors where they
were predominant—farmworkers and domestic workers.3
 Today, the
workplace conditions for farm and slaughterhouse workers are partially
a product of the precarity of the migrants filling these positions.
Focusing on the second problem with unequal opportunities, spatial
segregation and restrictions on mobility can be shown to be similarly
unjust. They contribute to an unequal distribution of opportunities and
incentivize a clustering of costs and risks in marginalized communities.
This has significant implications for migration. The spatial segregation of
labor—generated by the current era of transnational capitalism and protected by the current regime of border control—helps situate the worst
effects of a transnational economy there rather than here, negatively impacting them and not us.
Though they are presented as neutral in their exclusion, borders are
selectively enforced. Borders for transnational corporations (TNCs) are
porous, designed to facilitate their movement. Affluent, skilled, and white
migrants face relatively relaxed borders, with many countries positively
competing for them. However, citizens of low-income countries—particularly poor people of color—find either all-but impenetrable borders or
admission only through restrictive (and exploitative) temporary worker
programs or illicit entry. This asymmetry in mobility exacerbates an independent asymmetry in power. It leaves the globally least-advantaged
trapped in place, where undesirable opportunities can be clustered, and

costs and risks can be segregated away from high-income countries and
their citizens.
In response, I argue for an extension of one of the tools used to
prevent group-based social control and the segregation of unequal opportunities domestically: the right to move across space. This right can
serve three roles. First, it increases the autonomy of those suffering the
greatest autonomy deficit. Second, it allows people to improve their life
prospects. Third, and most importantly, it prevents the spatial clustering
of negative externalities and undesirable opportunities.
Equality of Opportunity and Migration
The liberal conception of EO is most prominently developed by John
Rawls. On Rawls’s view, socioeconomic inequalities are only justifiable
if they are: a) attached to positions available to all under conditions of
fair equality of opportunity (FEO), and b) to the greatest advantage of
the least-advantaged group.4
 FEO requires not just non-discrimination,
but also that those who are equally talented and motivated should have
the same likelihood of success.5
 This involves restricting inequality and
equalizing educational resources.
However, this extends well beyond the schoolhouse, applying to all
aspects of society that reliably affect development.6
 Environmental toxins, prenatal nutrition, access to childcare, and healthcare are also among
the social determinants of opportunity. Left unregulated, they distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of group membership—e.g., race,
gender, and class. They ensure that the least desirable opportunities are
clustered around the least-advantaged.
Joseph Carens helped popularize the global extension of EO, arguing
that citizenship is the last “feudal privilege” accepted within liberalism.
Liberal philosophers reject hierarchies based on race, sex, religion, and
class. Most accept the Rawlsian demand that all citizens have equal access
to desirable opportunities. Yet this value often has rigid borders. We have
“a commitment to equality of opportunity for people within democratic
states . . . , but no pretense, or even aspiration. . .across states.”7
 Arbitrary
facts about one’s birth are coercively enforced, restricting people’s mobility and trapping them in the opportunity sets into which they were born.
This is, on Carens’s view, clearly unjust. After all, the ideal of EO “is
intimately linked to the view that all human beings are of equal moral
worth.”8
 However, despite this moral equality, “contemporary social arrangements not only grant great advantages on the basis of birth but also
entrench these advantages by legally restricting mobility.”9

Michael Ball-Blakely | Migration, Mobility, and Spatial Segregation: Freedom of Movement  69
Carens’s solution is to guarantee that everybody has the right to immigrate in pursuit of better opportunities. This prevents people from
being trapped in undesirable opportunity sets, ending what Carens identifies as a citizenship-based global caste system. While this is not sufficient to ensure that Rawls’s FEO is met globally, freedom of movement is
necessary for equalizing opportunities in a world where citizenship determines life prospects. It gives people the right, if not ability, to pursue
desirable opportunities.
There have been several prominent criticisms of Carens’s argument.
First, critics have pushed back against the luck egalitarianism implicit in
Carens’s argument.10 While borders might be arbitrary and do cement
(un)lucky facts about one’s birth, this “is an embarrassment only for
those who thought of liberalism as requiring the elimination of random
chance.”11 Instead, liberalism is concerned with “how a political society
might justify its coercive laws and practices specifically to those within
its jurisdiction.”12 The goal is not to eliminate inequalities wherever they
are found and however they arose, but to ensure “that people are not subordinated or marginalized within relationships or institutional contexts
of which they are a part.”13
Second, critics argue that coercion is necessary for implementing
EO. Equalizing access to education, for example, requires a “government
or some set of institutions” with the power to enforce this requirement,
allocate funds, and ensure uniform academic standards.14 Promoting EO
is institutionally demanding, requiring considerable information, coercive control, and distributive capacities. It is a political value that can
only exist within the context of a coercive state with both the duty and
the power to promote equality between citizens.15 The lack of relevant
institutions globally suggests that global EO is an inert moral value with
little practical political applicability.
Third, critics argue that EO is a distinctly cultural value and hence
incompatible with a global extension.16 The desirability of opportunities
is not given by nature but is largely a product of local values and the
history of the community. Therefore, while we might be able to rank opportunities domestically, and can take steps to ensure that citizens are
equally able to develop their talents and pursue desirable careers, we lack
the cultural homogeneity to do this globally.
These criticisms raise important questions about a global extension
of EO. We need to know exactly what the extension requires—is it the
full version of EO, or merely open borders as a way of promoting EO?
My goal will be to explain why freedom of movement is a part of EO and

70  Essays in Philosophy Volume 22, Issue 1–2
why it is required globally. This involves justifying both the extension of
EO and why the focus is on freedom of movement in particular.
The literature on EO has largely focused on group-based labor market segregation within space. On this view, EO is violated when groups of
people within a particular area are restricted to a cluster of undesirable
opportunities—due to unequal educational opportunities or discrimination. My project is to develop a second focus: space-based labor market
segregation. Here there are groups that are spatially segregated, who have
limited access to move across space, and whose spatial location shapes
their opportunities.17
By analyzing feudal caste systems and segregation I show how spatial
segregation and restrictions on mobility have been intimately bound up
with questions of EO. A common way of perpetuating unequal opportunities, and maintaining social control, has been through restricting mobility. Finally, I discuss how the transnational economy has generated a
new set of relationships within which freedom of movement has become
an important element of global EO.18
Feudalism, Segregation, and Equal Opportunity
Joseph Carens drew attention to some of the parallels between feudalism
and our current migration regime in order to highlight the injustice of
our current practice. Both practices involve inherited privileges as well
as coercive restrictions on mobility that cement unequal opportunity.19
In this section I expand on this analysis, illustrating how spatial segregation does not just prevent people from leaving the bad opportunities that
they were unlucky enough to inherit, but that it also helps create these
opportunities, permitting exploitation and control of a prone population.
While feudal societies are more complicated than popular presentations suggest, the basic relationship between feudal lords and serfs involved three elements. First, the authority wielded by the lord over the
serf. Second, the right of the serf to work a plot of land to secure their
means of subsistence. And third, the requirement that the serf work for
the lord several days per week, unremunerated save for the protection
and land offered by the lord.
Within feudal systems, a serf “receives the use of a small plot of land
instead of wages and. . .produces goods for the lord on pain of physical coercion.”20 If they sought to exit the relationship, fleeing to nearby
towns, they were treated as thieves. This was “reflected in the laws which
tie serfs to the land and which prevent the flight of serfs to the city. . .the

fleeing serf, like the fleeing slave, has stolen property from the lord.”21
They were thus chained to their social position, the lord, and the land.
Restrictions on movement across social positions and space were
vital to the feudal system. Without hereditary privileges, the risks of serfdom would fall equally on all. Without binding serfs to the land and
lord, many would simply leave feudal relationships, or offer themselves
to kindlier lords. These restrictions allowed lords to retain their authority
and complete bargaining advantage.
While we should be cautious of making analogies between time periods and between distinct societies, many of the problematic features
of feudalism—assignation to fixed, hierarchical and exploitative social
positions and spatial segregation—characterize many contemporary social and economic arrangements. Spatial segregation continues to divide
people, tie them to land, and shape their life prospects. The history of
the U.S., for example, involves a cruel coalescence of de jure and de facto
segregation. Coates detailed how redlining intentionally worked towards
the segregation of neighborhoods, forcing black home buyers into a contract system that had deleterious effects on black wealth. Specifically, the
U.S. government “insured private mortgages” but “adopted a system of
maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability.”22
Mixed-race and black neighborhoods were labeled unstable, redlined,
and became ineligible for FHA-backed loans.
Richard Rothstein notes that de jure segregation in the U.S. did not
end with redlining. Instead, “real estate commissions licensed members
of local and national real estate boards whose published codes of ethics
mandated discrimination.”23 Lending agents that were underwritten—
and monitored—by the state offered discriminatory loans.24 Moreover,
“[i]t wasn’t only the large-scale federal programs of public housing and
mortgage finance that created de jure segregation. Hundreds, if not thousands, of smaller acts of government contributed,” including “denial of
access to public utilities,” “routing interstate highways to create racial
boundaries,” and unequal public spending in nonwhite neighborhoods.25
Segregation has several implications for socioeconomic justice. First,
segregated communities are more susceptible to group-based social control—the “war on drugs” in the U.S. being a clear example. Targeted
control is facilitated by segregation, permitting increased enforcement
in Black and other minoritized communities.26 If affluent white citizens
suffered the consequences of the war on drugs, the political blowback
would render such policies untenable. This system requires that negative

72  Essays in Philosophy Volume 22, Issue 1–2
effects be localized in racial communities and spatial segregation facilitates this segregation of effects.
Second, segregation permits the worst externalities of production
to be clustered in marginalized communities. Manufacturing zones are
largely situated in poor, often nonwhite neighborhoods because doing
so is less costly—both economically and politically.27 And factory farms
are disproportionately located in poor communities of color.28 This has
devastating effects on home values, quality of living, and health for those
living in the shadows of their effluence.
Third, communities segregated by race and socioeconomic class are
more often both job and consumer-goods deserts.29 With white flight,
disinvestment, and increased rates of poverty, segregated communities
of marginalized people become undesirable to, and operate at a deficit
of, consumer-driven businesses.30 The loss of wealth due to white flight
means that middle class consumers make up a smaller percentage of the
community. With disinvestment, these communities also lack the economic policies that attract businesses—community development, infrastructure, and favorable tax breaks for corporations. The result is a
dearth of jobs and material goods as businesses increasingly locate closer
to the suburbs and other middle-class, white communities.31
Finally, a large population of poor and more often unemployed citizens is ripe for exploitation. Those with few employment options and
desperate for income are more likely to accept lower salaries and worse
workplace conditions. Spatial segregation, therefore, can decrease bargaining power and leave people prone in their relationships with employers.
Feudal systems and segregated societies illustrate several reasons
why space and mobility matter. First, restrictions on mobility leave
people trapped in place, prone, and with little (or no) bargaining power.
This can affect their status with both the state and employers, making
social control, violence, marginalization, and hyper-exploitation more
likely. Second, a segregated and marginalized community is likely to
experience the worst externalities of production, with segregation also
exacerbating these externalities. If the costs of cheap transnational production—environmental degradation, weakly integrated TNCs with
plentiful exit options, unlivable wages, and poor workplaces conditions,
for example—are isolated over there and with them, there is little incentive to work on regulating and restricting them. And third, segregated
and immobile communities are liable to suffer from the relative mobility

of capital, as they are at greater risk of becoming job and consumer-good
deserts.32
Building on Rawls’s conception, and incorporating the lessons from
feudalism and segregation, I identify four tools for promoting EO. The
first is formal freedom of movement. The second is adequate resources
to take advantage of mobility rights. The third is a principle of non-discrimination by admissions and hiring committees. And the fourth is a
requirement that all persons have an equal chance to develop their talents.
These elements contribute, in different ways, to preventing the
space- or group-based clustering of negative externalities and powerlessness in an economic practice. The first two prevent the spatial segregation of costs and risks by ensuring that people can leave undesirable
opportunity sets. The last two prevent the group-based segregation of
opportunities within space by ensuring that people are not prevented—
by the socioeconomic position of their birth—from accessing desirable
opportunities.
The requirements of EO depend upon the nature of the practice and
the needs of the parties within it. Domestically, the inescapable and determinative nature of the economic system, combined with states’ duties
to citizens, suggests that all four requirements are necessary. Freedom
of movement and adequate resources help prevent de jure and de facto
segregation. Non-discrimination and substantively equal educational
opportunities ensure that people do not inherit their social position.
At present, citizens of low-income countries suffer a considerable
power disadvantage in their relationships with TNCs and high-income
countries. Restrictions on their mobility not only leave them trapped in
undesirable opportunity sets, but they also perpetuate and exacerbate
these undesirable opportunities. Closure segregates the costs in lowincome countries, allowing TNCs and high-income countries to avoid
the negative externalities incurred by their actions, and prevents the migration of those who experience the worst effects of the transnational
practice.
Freedom of movement as EO is required as a tool for eliminating the
spatial segregation of negative externalities and opportunities in the current global practice. This is not to say, however, that increased mobility is
the only possible solution. Placing restrictions on the behavior of TNCs
and high-income countries while enacting policies aimed at eliminating
global inequalities would also mitigate the spatial segregation of undesirable opportunities and externalities. However, this option remains a
distant possibility, foreclosed for now by the lack of institutions and poGenerated for EBSCO inc. 2021/3/17 © 2021 Philosophy Documentation Center http://www.pdcnet.org
74  Essays in Philosophy Volume 22, Issue 1–2
litical will. Moreover, we have seen in the U.S. that even with all of the
protections of a liberal democracy, spatial segregation leaves the rights of
some groups insecure and unstable. Accordingly, maintaining a system
of border control while working to extend other protections is a precarious and likely only partial solution even if enacted.
Finally, while fully achieving global EO involves other elements—
specifically, non-discrimination in admissions policies and adequate resources to migrate—I am only arguing for the necessity of freedom of
movement. One reason for this is the deep controversy surrounding the
full global extension of EO. I aim to present an argument for freedom
of movement as a part of EO that is more easily embraced by political
liberals for whom the full range of socioeconomic rights are dependent
upon coercion or robust political relationships. Moreover, freedom of
movement might, if enacted, have dramatic effects on the global practice.
If increased mobility can change the incentive structure of high-income
countries and TNCs, as well as motivate a reduction of negative externalities and undermine relationships of domination, then progress towards
global equality should result.
Mobility, Space, and the Transnational Economy
Whether it warrants the full extension of EO, the effects of the global
practice on the least-advantaged suffice to require freedom of movement
as a tool for EO.33 Border controls are not univocally applied and have
radically different impacts depending on who—or what—is seeking to
cross them. Capital enjoys porous borders designed to facilitate its mobility. The affluent and “skilled” have a much easier time immigrating
to the most desirable countries. However, the global poor find nearly
impenetrable borders created to keep them from entering high-income
countries.
This tiered system of borders is a feature of what William Robinson
calls a transnational economy. The stage of globalization that was marked
by a world economy largely involved national production and international trade. Global organizations could exert pressure on countries to
liberalize and powerful countries could resort to violence as well as tariffs and subsidies. However, during the world economy, production still
occurred primarily within national boundaries. And if corporations had
needs for foreign labor, they had to have it brought to them.
Transnational capitalism has seen these borders weakened for TNCs
but hardened to the movement of most people. In this way, TNCs are
largely “liberated from the nation-state” and with increased mobility capiGenerated for EBSCO inc. 2021/3/17 © 2021 Philosophy Documentation Center http://www.pdcnet.org
Michael Ball-Blakely | Migration, Mobility, and Spatial Segregation: Freedom of Movement  75
tal has “assumed tremendous new power relative to labor.”34 Production is
severed from the home countries of TNCs and fragmented into subsidiaries that each perform small, relatively isolated stages of production.
This has several implications. First, it has given capital greater power
over countries. Able to move freely, TNCs can demand minimal labor
and environmental standards, decreased tax burdens, and low wages.
This mobility has made it:
difficult to ‘trap’ capital in any one place long enough to regulate its
practices or tax its profits, much less bargain collectively with it on an
equal footing. . .In the process of losing dominion over place, ordinary
workers, consumers, and citizens seem to lose the leverage they need to
exert influence on the key decisions that affect their lives.35
This has shifted a delicate balance of power where workers were already
facing a power deficit. Corporations have become detethered from the
state, where control over their behavior was at least feasible, and left free
to pursue the most profitable jurisdictions to the detriment of national
sovereignty and worker protections.36
Whether this creates a “race to the bottom,” with countries downwardly competing for TNCs, “tax competition undermines the fiscal
self-determination of states, that is, their ability to effectively set the size
of the budget and the extent of redistribution.”37 The result is not just
distributive but concerns the balance of power itself. The global search
for the most profitable site for production means that “de facto control
over actual government revenues is considerably weakened.”38 Economic
policies become shaped by TNCs that can just as easily relocate or refuse
to come in the first place.
Control over low-income countries and their citizens is not only
wielded by TNCs.39 High-income countries also shape international
organizations to suit their interests. Low-income countries have “little
choice but to join these organizations, yet, as members, have limited influence over them.”40 These organizations then place stringent demands
on economic policies, enforcing a uniform liberalization on low-income
countries.
Moreover, would-be migrants do not first confront high-income
countries when they petition for entry, but “are in a relationship of dependence with the countries which exclude them” and “either cannot
leave the relationship, or their exist costs are too high for them to do so
realistically.”41 High-income countries and international organizations
exercise power over low-income countries, affecting the policy decisions

76  Essays in Philosophy Volume 22, Issue 1–2
of the latter to suit the interests of the former. Control over migration
maintains this relationship and the powerlessness of the least-advantaged within it.
This analysis fits comfortably within the literature on world systems
theory.42 According to this view, “migration is a natural outgrowth of
disruptions and dislocations that inevitably occur in the process of capitalist development” (Massey, et al. 1993 p. 445). Patterns of migration are
not simply the result of would-be migrants pursuing higher wages, better workplace conditions, and increased political stability. Instead, “[m]
igration is caused by the disruption of economies in the periphery that
are transformed for the benefit of the developed world (the core).”43 The
behavior of TNCs and high-income countries destabilizes and disrupts
economies of low-income countries, while at the same time creating the
cultural and economic linkages that motivate movement—or, at least,
the desire to immigrate—into these same high-income countries.44
The costs of this system for the least-advantaged would ordinarily
precipitate movement from low- to high-income countries. However,
border control “shields prosperous and peaceful states from the great
majority of those who—in a world without borders and exclusive citizenries—would seek to flee war, civil strife, famine, joblessness, or environmental degradation.”45 If high-income countries experienced the
spillover effects of production—or their foreign policy—they might
work to prevent them from occurring. Borders, however, trap these costs
in place, preventing them from affecting the globally advantaged. This
both perpetuates and exacerbates these costs.
Second, the transnational economy has increased the relative power
of capital. With TNCs able to leave in pursuit of cheaper production,
workers have lost a powerful bargaining chip, diminishing already meager labor protections. Were corporations trapped in place, they could not
leverage the existence of the rest of the global labor force against employees. And without such impenetrable borders, TNCs would no longer find
a prone, trapped workforce. People would instead be able to immigrate
to countries where workplace standards and wages were more palatable.
The relationship, therefore, depends on the different ways that borders
operate for capital and labor.
Third, the ability to fragment production between nations eliminates
the need to develop infrastructure and education where production occurs. The infrastructure that accompanies TNCs is often weakly integrated, aimed more at moving goods out of the country than meeting
domestic needs. This can be seen in the highways constructed in Mexico

in the 1940s, “which followed the blueprint of U.S.-built railroads that
were laid out in a north-south pattern. Building the roads in this fashion
facilitated the export of goods. . .and only secondarily were these roads
connected with Mexico’s economic heartland.”46 This is part of a trend
where TNCs fail to embed themselves within domestic supply chains in
the ways that make for a vibrant economy. For example, maquila plants
were “little more than export platforms disconnected from the rest of
Mexico’s economy” and had “little ‘spin-off ’ effects; they are islands of
U.S. production in Mexico’s soil.”47 This not only increases the bargaining power of TNCs, but it means that low-income countries often do not
enjoy most of the benefits of globalization.
The lucrative flexibility of capital and the privileges of affluent citizens in high-income countries depend upon a system of divided citizenships. This provides capital with a reserve army of labor, to be brought
here, pursued there, or ignored depending on need. It ensures that those
who suffer negative externalities are prone non-nationals. And it means
that aggressive behavior by high-income countries—e.g., regime change
or war for natural resources—does not necessarily lead to mass migration into these high-income countries. This reduces the costs for the affluent by keeping costs located in segregated communities of the globally
marginalized.
Equal Opportunity Revisited
Without freedom of movement, costs and benefits become segregated
and unequal opportunities become generationally entrenched. Within
feudalism, restrictions on mobility kept serfs chained to the land and
lord. Segregated communities of marginalized groups help isolate negative political and economic externalities, leaving some suffering the
most severe costs of political and economic policies. Similarly, within
the transnational economy, restrictions on mobility help create prone
populations where environmental costs, low-wage work, and weakly integrated production can all be reliably located.
This system also generates perverse incentivizes in TNCs and highincome countries. Without having to suffer the costs of production or
foreign policy decisions—e.g., the mass migration of those negatively
impacted—there will be little incentive to check pernicious behavior. A
vital role of freedom of movement, therefore, is equalizing bargaining
power and changing incentive structures within an economic practice.48
While there are reasons for endorsing the other elements of EO—
group-based discrimination in migration policies is largely seen as imGenerated for EBSCO inc. 2021/3/17 © 2021 Philosophy Documentation Center http://www.pdcnet.org

permissible and unequal resources leave many of the least-advantaged
unable to make use of formal mobility rights—I have focused solely on
freedom of movement. It can be a vital tool for disincentivizing the clustering of negative externalities and undesirable opportunities in lowincome countries and giving the least-advantaged the ability to pursue
better life prospects.
This is not an argument for eliminating either territorial boundaries
or the privileges of citizenship. Nor is it an argument against any restrictions on mobility. Public order exemptions would still be available to
high-income countries. Moreover, it is decidedly not an argument for
open borders from high- to low-income countries.49 Instead, it is only an
argument that high-income countries have a duty of justice to eliminate
restrictions on mobility from low-income countries.
This account serves three roles. First, it further explains the relationship between freedom of movement and EO. Second, it illustrates why
freedom of movement as a tool for EO is warranted. And third, it is more
compatible with political liberalism and can better avoid the criticisms
listed above. Since the first and second have already been discussed, I will
now briefly explain how it avoids these standard objections.
According to critics, Carens’s argument for a global extension of EO
ignores the intrinsically political and relational nature of EO. Its normative significance, they argue, depends upon people being members of a
shared society within which unequal opportunity creates hierarchies between equal citizens, or where the state must justify its use of coercion to
citizens. On my account, however, the goal of freedom of movement as
EO is not to promote global economic equality, nor is the goal to eliminate the effects of luck. Instead, the goal is to eliminate the space-based
oppression and control of the globally least-advantaged. It is not just
that borders prevent people from pursuing desirable opportunities; they
also incentivize the creation and clustering of undesirable opportunities
and negative externalities. If restrictions on mobility predictably lead to
power being harmfully wielded against the least-advantaged, then it is
unjust whether it happens within or across state borders.
Critics also argue that coercion is vital for achieving EO. To ensure
equal access to desirable opportunities we have to have institutions with
the power to secure these goals. There are, at present, no institutions with
the ability to promote equal education or to ensure that opportunities
are spread diffusely around the world. And unilateral action in a transnational economy is unlikely to secure the kind of background justice
needed for a full global extension of EO—even if we had the political

will to pursue it. However, despite serious questions about political will,
and despite there being considerable problems for states that unilaterally
open their borders in response to injustice, we do not require coercive
institutions to implement freedom of movement. There is not an institutional barrier to open borders, only problems of coordination and political will.
Finally, critics have argued that a global extension of EO ignores the
intrinsically cultural nature of desirable opportunities. We cannot ensure
that all have equal access to equally desirable opportunities without having some universal metric for ranking opportunities. This might raise
some problems for a full global extension of EO—though I am skeptical
about whether we can achieve a coherent ranking nationally, and the
spirit of EO is providing people with the tools to make their own decisions about how to develop and apply their talents. It is not, however, a
problem for freedom of movement as a tool for equalizing opportunities. This limited conclusion does not require that we identify and rank
the most valuable opportunities. It only requires that borders be opened
from low- to high-income countries.
Conclusion
In this paper I have argued for a reinterpretation of EO. An examination
of feudalism and segregation reveals how restrictions on mobility and
on opportunities are interwoven. By being held in place—through legal
restrictions, group-based discrimination, or poverty—people become
trapped and powerless, susceptible to social control and economic oppression. Freedom of movement plays a vital role not only in preventing
this, but in disincentivizing this treatment in the first place. By losing a
prone population, states and TNCs must modify their behavior in light
of the effects of their policies. If hyper-exploitation and environmental
degradation lead people to leave in pursuit of better workplace and environmental protections, then these policies are no longer rational. The
movement of individuals allows the least-advantaged to modify the incentive structure of powerful actors.
This analysis of EO helps explain why the ideal applies globally. By
dividing EO into its basic elements, unpacking them and evaluating
their applicability individually, it avoids unduly extending domestic conceptions of justice. It avoids making controversial claims about global
egalitarian duties or the significance of luck. And it deploys a normative
premise—that leveraging people’s powerlessness to force them to accept

Reconsidering Feudalism
in Old Regime Central France
NANCY FITCH
abstract This article examines the changing nature of aristocratic land acquisitions in
central France in the centuries before the outbreak of revolution in 1789. It shows how nobles
bought up or confiscated peasant land to engross large estates. Since their acquisition rarely
altered the legal status of such lands, aristocrats surprisingly were among those responsible
for paying the bulk of the feudal dues at the end of the Old Regime (and were probably the
major beneficiaries when the French Revolution abolished them). These “entrepreneurial”
nobles often blended new kinds of industry with traditional forms of agriculture; they also
increasingly deprived peasants of land and grazing rights. By exploring changing patterns in
aristocratic landholding, this article shows how the nobility in central France contributed
both to the development of capitalism and industrialization in France and to rising peasant
anger at the beginning of the French Revolution.

Louise-Marie de Las, born into a world of privileged nobility, was just eight
years old in 1754 when she first felt the negative weight of feudalism on her
family.1 Her uncle, Louis-Henri de Las, the marquis of Azy, died without direct
heirs; this allowed seigneur Charles Andras de Marcy to reclaim much of the de
Las land according to feudal custom. Louis-Henri, however, had wanted his
estate to go to his nephew Michel-Mathieu, Louise’s brother. Her mother,

1. Scholars have argued over the appropriate word for the social/economic system that characterized
France in 1789. Though historians frequently use the word seigneurialism to discuss what I refer to here as
“feudalism” (fe´odalite´), I believe the latter is more faithful to the social and economic world rhetorically constructed by the men and women who lived during the eighteenth century. See Markoff, Abolition of Feudalism, introd., 516–60; Gallet, Seigneurs et paysans, esp. 7–9, 247–57; Mackrell, Attack on “Feudalism”; Vovelle,

valuable property in the Nivernais, paid thousands of livres to the seigneur to
abandon his right to the land. Fourteen years later Louise was living in a convent
when her unmarried brother died during military service in Strasbourg. Once
again, Andras de Marcy and other seigneurs exercised their privileges to reclaim
land in the de Las estate. With a large fortune at stake, lawsuits appeared from
everywhere; litigants included these seigneurs, Louise’s mother, an aunt, the
prior and canons of Saint-Martin de Nevers, the priest of Druy, notaries, royal
and ducal officeholders, and ironmasters, all of whom went to court for land,
money, and forges. Not until 1778, after ten years of contested claims, complex
court proceedings, and significant cash transactions, did the Parlement of Paris
render a judgment naming Louise-Marie de Las the lawful heir of all of the family
properties, but only after she paid Andras de Marcy and others to not exercise
their feudal prerogatives.2
Fights over property were common in Old Regime France, as they are now;
nevertheless, Louise’s situation was aggravated by the fact that much of the family’s estate consisted of land it had acquired from peasants living on the manors
of other seigneurs and thus subject to various feudal constraints. The most
important of these constraints was mainmorte, which required heirs to be living
with the deceased at the time of death to inherit property. This feudal custom
had developed as a way to tie peasants to a seigneurie in the late Middle Ages,
when labor was scarce and peasant flight common. It was not a very suitable
form of land tenure, however, for a single nobleman who died during military
service in Strasbourg, with a mother in Paris or Nevers and a sister in a convent.3
In fact, as it became clear that she might inherit her brother’s property,
Louise made sure that this land would not revert back to other seigneurs. On
April 26, 1769, de Las legally recognized that she owed dues and fees for meadows Michel-Mathieu had held as a tenant of the cathedral of Nevers. On May 8
the seigneur of Bozas, acting for Louise, acknowledged fines due on land the
family had held as a tenant of the monastery where she had resided. On July 30
Louise, now calling herself the marquise of Azy and baroness of Prye, conceded

that she was obligated to pay still more fines and fees to retain property the family had acquired as tenants from the commanderie du Feuilloux.4
Most of the familiar characters from the script of Old Regime France
made an appearance as Louise de Las grappled with feudal tenures and customary law to secure her inheritance. Aided by her 1771 marriage to the seigneur of
Bozas, the marquise took nothing about her situation for granted. Still, almost
everything in this story seems out of place.
Historians know that remnants of feudalism persisted in much of France.5
Even so, the story of the de Las inheritance challenges most of the assumptions
associated with its practice. For instance, why was the de Las family paying,
rather than collecting, feudal dues? Why were prominent aristocrats fearful of
losing their land to other seigneurs because they were subject to mainmorte?
Why did ironmasters play a role in the story of this rural family’s fortune? And
where in this story were the peasants—the people that seigneurs at one time
wanted to tie to the land? This last question is especially important because in a
few short years these very peasants would explode in anger against seigneurs,
bourgeois landowners, and the church in the Bourbonnais and Nivernais—
perhaps because they no longer held much land they could be tied to.
If the example of the de Las family’s travails is in any way characteristic of
aristocratic experience in at least some parts of France, as I believe it is, this suggests at a minimum that historians may need to rethink much of what we
thought we knew about lords, peasants, and property ownership in the late eighteenth century, when revolution engulfed France. As Jay M. Smith asked in the
introduction to his 2006 collection on the Old Regime French aristocracy, after
decades of historical neglect, “what kind of nobility should be reinserted into the
narrative framework of eighteenth century history?”6 The answer according to
4. The seigneur of Bozas—Emmanuel-Gaspard-Jeanne-Marie du Bourg (1740–88)—was also
Louise-Marie de Las’s first cousin. She married him on Sept. 26, 1771, after obtaining a papal dispensation
and other legal authorizations. ADN, 2 F 55, 2 F 274, 2 F 277. See also Drouillet, Drouillet, and Drouillet, Histoire de Saint-Benin-d’Azy, 138–65.
5. On the eve of the Revolution there were still half a million to a million unfree personal “serfs” in
France, mostly concentrated in a crescent-shaped semicircle that encompassed much of eastern France (Lorraine, Franche-Comte´, and the Jura) and then swung across the northern and southern parts of Burgundy
and into the Nivernais. Millions more, including many in the Bourbonnais and the Nivernais, found themselves hemmed in by mainmorte re´elle, which fell on quasi-entailed land. As Thierry Bressan pointed out, the
existence of these serfs and quasi serfs did not necessarily correspond to the three orders in France, nor
could serfdom be associated easily with specific social classes. Most important, he noted that “a small minority of them [serfs] formed a rural bourgeoisie with considerable revenues and participated in an active way
in their own villages’ land markets” (“Le servage residual,” 66). See also Gallet, Seigneurs et paysans, 76–100,

many recent studies is an aristocracy that constituted an entrepreneurial elite—
one that profited enormously from what several historians have labeled “court
capitalism” but that also included land managers and industrial entrepreneurs
in the countryside. This is important work that portrays a vibrant though
divided aristocracy that often used its feudal privileges and access to the spoils
of the absolutist state to construct market monopolies. More provocative, however, is Robert M. Schwartz’s peripheral observation that “with the bulk of the
Burgundian peasants largely landless, enterprising seigneurs sometimes found
themselves knocking heads with bourgeois and nobles who had come to own
much if not most of the land in their lordships.”7 Schwartz did not follow up on
his comment, but he has identified in Burgundian estates what Louise de Las’s
story points to in the Nivernais: aristocratic families holding property in other
seigneurs’ lordships that might be subject to feudal dues and restrictions.
The idea that the nobility might have used their prerogatives to corner
land markets by undermining supposedly secure peasant property rights should
surprise no one, but remarkably little attention has been paid to where and why
aristocrats might have acquired land subject to feudal dues and obligations and
what these acquisitions might imply about social and property relations on the
eve of the French Revolution. By examining case studies from the Bourbonnais
and the Nivernais in central France, I demonstrate the changing nature of aristocratic land acquisitions in the centuries before the outbreak of revolution in
1789. Surprisingly, these acquisitions reveal that aristocratic and bourgeois landowners were among those responsible for the bulk of the feudal dues at the end
of the Old Regime (and probably the major beneficiaries when the French Revolution abolished them). In the words of Annie Antoine, “The majority of studies
on the seigneurie suppose that it is always the peasants who pay seigneurial
dues. This idea is false.”8
in Smith’s volume and in a two-volume 2002 work from France argue that until recently the study of the
French nobility has largely been “abandoned to genealogists, specialists in heraldry, and mundane biographies” (Pontet, Figeac, and Boisson, La noblesse, 1:5). See also Bourdin, Les noblesses franc¸aises; Vivier, Elites
et progre`s agricole, 9–15; Chaussinand-Nogaret, French Nobility; and Richard, La noblesse d’affaires.

8. Antoine, “La seigneurie en France,” 58. The de Las family, like many French nobles, may have had
bourgeois origins in the sixteenth century. Esme de Las, seigneur of la Coudre, is the first de Las to appear in
the records analyzed here. He acquired the fief of la Valotte in 1581 and was officially recorded as a noble in
the Election of Nevers in 1599. Moreover, there is no question that bourgeois landowners also acquired peasant property subject to feudal dues in central France. I focus on aristocrats here because I believe that their
property acquisitions in the countryside are part of a larger story that has not figured prominently in the historiography. The two exceptions are Lelong, Le bocage Bourbonnais, and Goldsmith, Lordship in France, esp.
6–23. For the de Las genealogy, see Drouillet, Drouillet, and Drouillet, Histoire de Saint-Benin-d’Azy, 129–32.

The Bourbonnais and the Nivernais (fig. 1) were not unique in this respect.
Indeed, estimating that somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of the farmland
in France belonged exclusively to nobles, bourgeois, and ecclesiastical institutions, other historians have guessed that it is possible that they were the ones
who probably profited when feudal dues and restrictions were abolished. Yet
with few exceptions the scale and significance of aristocratic land acquisitions

have not been closely examined in relation to either the transition from feudalism to capitalism in France or to the origins of peasant anger at the beginning of
the French Revolution.9
As I demonstrate here, evidence from the Bourbonnais and the Nivernais
suggests that by the late eighteenth century feudal and market-based economies
had already become integrated in complex ways in the French countryside.10
This integration makes it difficult to fit the French case into Marxist or British
models of the transition. For Karl Marx, “the expropriation of the agricultural
producer, or the peasant, from the soil, is the basis of the whole process [of capitalist development].” Using a comparative framework, Robert Brenner elaborated on Marx’s ideas in a series of influential articles that compared English
and French developments from the late thirteenth until the late eighteenth century. The “Brenner debate” subsequently involved many of the most significant
scholars from England and France. Briefly stated, Brenner argued that because
English landlords had successfully combated medieval peasant resistance, they
were able to consolidate their holdings in the late fifteenth century, eventually
leasing their estates to well-off tenants who were compelled to compete with
one another to obtain and maintain their leaseholds. Their competitive behavior
to cut costs and increase profits ultimately culminated in the development of
capitalist agriculture and industrialization in England. Many French agricultural
and modern Marxist historians, including Brenner, have contrasted this English
experience to that of France, where in this same period, they argued, peasants
were able to gain fairly secure rights to their property and hence had no reason
to engage in agricultural innovation as long as they could feed their families.
Thus, when capitalism did develop in France, it emerged in later centuries in a
unique “peasant way.”11
9. Data on landownership in France come from different kinds of sources found in a variety of village and regional studies, so estimates of how much land the nobility and the bourgeoisie owned are at best
speculations. There has been relatively little work on landownership in central France. Nonetheless, several
studies either explicitly or implicitly suggest that the nobility and bourgeois might have paid a substantial
portion of the feudal dues at the end of the Old Regime. These include Lelong, Le bocage Bourbonnais; Goldsmith, Lordship in France; Antoine, “La seigneurie en France,” 58–59; Bois, Paysans de l’Ouest, 160–82;
Antoine, Fiefs et villages du Bas-Maine, 197, 237, 289–90; and Bart, La liberte´ ou la terre.
10. The best discussion of this is Lelong, Le bocage Bourbonnais. I am greatly indebted to his work
and impressed by his various attempts to model the complex Old Regime economy both in this work and in
previous studies. His pathbreaking efforts deserve far greater attention and provide some of the data analyzed here. See also Lelong, “La socie´te´ bourbonnaise,” and Chaussinand-Nogaret, “Noblesse et capitalisme.”

Much of this debate revolved around fourteenth- and fifteenth-century
developments and emphasized the fact that fifteenth-century French peasants,
unlike their English counterparts, could fix in perpetuity the rents owed to their
lords for their use of their land. Nonetheless, despite peasant victories in many
parts of France, much of the French nobility could still reconstruct their estates
in such a way that arbitrary transaction fees persisted, while peasant land in central and eastern France remained quasi-entailed, that is, subject to mainmorte.
In the ensuing centuries economic conditions so degenerated for the peasantry
in many regions that it has been estimated that peasants lost much of whatever
land they held by the outbreak of revolution. As a result, leasing land, buildings,
and animals to propertyless sharecroppers became the norm in much of the
country. The language of feudalism remained in use until 1789, so documents
refer to “fief,” “homage,” “foi,” “colon,” and “corve´es,” but the words no longer
meant what they did in the Middle Ages. “Fiefs,” for example, still largely
belonged to the nobility, but, in the words of Jean Gallet, they had become
instruments “of profits, transmittable to women as inheritances, objects of sales,
exchanges and mortgages, of commerce. The new feudalism was no longer military, it was simply [a civil arrangement].”12 The new feudalism also appeared to
be a lot like what some historians have defined as capitalism. This is especially
true if capitalism indicates that “land itself is a commodity that could be bought
and sold; that laborers increasingly lost access to land; and that production for a
cash economy shaped social and political relationships.”13
As John Markoff has argued, “Both in daily practice and in ideological justification, ‘feudal’ and modern practices and conceptions were so completely
intertwined that the attempt to abolish the former [during the French Revolution] in order to emancipate the latter was, on the level of detail, a hopeless project.”14 Yet, as John Wesley Shaffer established for the Nivernais, while seigneurs
were engaging in new forms of industrial production, they also pursued traditional farming methods on an expanded scale, especially through their extensive
use of sharecroppers.15 Thus it is not easy to discern if the de Las family and
Revolutions? Classic studies of the “peasant road to capitalism” include Gauthier, La voie paysanne, and Ado,
Paysans en re´volution.
12. Gallet, Seigneurs et paysans, 8. Much of the recent argument that France remained a country of
peasant proprietors rests on the work of Ge´rard Be´aur and his students, who suggest that peasants were
gaining land at the expense of the nobility and the bourgeoisie in the late eighteenth century. However, the
authors of most of these studies acknowledge that the nobility and bourgeoisie held most of the land in
France and that the land transactions they analyzed accounted for only about 1 percent per year of the land
in the villages and regions they explored. See Be´aur, Le marche´ foncier, 335; and Be´aur, Histoire agraire.

other central French seigneurs were “entrepreneurial nobles” engaging in early
forms of capitalism or something akin to “aristocratic serfs” who were themselves bound by older forms of feudalism. While I am being deliberately hyperbolic in suggesting that someone like Louise de Las might have been a kind of
“serf,”16 I believe the hyperbole is useful in highlighting the need to find a new
narrative—perhaps a new vocabulary—to explain the relationships among peasants, lords, and landownership in the age of revolution.
The hyperbole might also induce historians to unravel the processes that
led to the persistence of inequality in France outlined in Thomas Piketty’s 2014
best seller on modern capitalism, Capital in the Twenty-First Century. As this
French economist argued, although the inequality of wealth might have declined
slightly in France as a consequence of the French Revolution, “the top decile’s
share attained or even slightly exceeded 90 percent of total wealth on the eve of
1789.” More important, he concluded that even though the structure of capital
was entirely transformed, as landed capital was replaced by industrial and financial capital, “the most significant fact is that inequality of capital ownership
remained relatively stable at an extremely high level throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries.” This conclusion is reflected in evidence from the
Nivernais, where after the Revolution nearly half the department consisted of
estates that were over one hundred hectares (one hectare equals 2.5 acres). Sixty
property owners, including most of those discussed here, possessed over one
thousand hectares apiece, while nine nobles possessed between three thousand
and six thousand hectares of land, forests, and factories. Most of this land consolidation took place before 1789.17
To reconsider feudalism and the aristocracy in this context, it is necessary
to look at the major forces leading to noble acquisition of peasant land.
Throughout the country, including the Bourbonnais and the Nivernais, the
major rupture in traditional landholding seems to date from the late sixteenth
century, when many nobles as well as merchants and officeholders began to
acquire or confiscate peasant property, virtually extinguishing peasant landownership as a major phenomenon in the region, as well as in much of France.18 Rene´

Germain’s research highlights the significance of this sixteenth-century rupture
by revealing that feudal dues constituted the largest source of feudal revenues in
a fairly typical Bourbonnais seigneurie in the early fifteenth century before
acquisitive elites began to buy up peasant land. He also shows the division of a
classic seigneurie into three distinct components: the possession of seigneurial
courts (justice), the direct (domaine utile, mouvances), and the reserve (domaine
proche). Most (53 percent) of the seigneur’s revenues came from dues and fees
collected from peasants holding land in perpetuity in the part of the seigneurie
called the direct, in which property rights were divided between the peasantry
and the seigneur. Peasants could use their property however they liked as long
as they paid feudal dues to the lord, but the seigneur maintained eminent
domain over the land and could confiscate it if tenants failed to meet certain
obligations. Seigneurs, however, could not simply eject tenants if they wanted
the land for their own use.19
As elsewhere in France, by the end of the fifteenth century customary law
enforced by royal courts fixed the amount of dues and fees seigneurs could collect
from tenants, arguably because the king wanted to protect peasants from excessive charges so the monarchy could more easily tax them. Customary laws in
France also gave peasants such strong legal rights to the land that some historians
have described them as freeholders.20 Because rents in this sector were determined and limited by customary law, the seigneurial direct is often referred to as
the “customary sector,” and the fees as “customary rents.” At the same time the
seigneur also held a substantial amount of land in his reserve, especially in forests. The seigneur could do anything he wanted with this land and could lease it
for market-based rents. Since most feudal revenues came from the customary
sector in the late Middle Ages, this means that seigneurs potentially faced serious
financial difficulties after customary law fixed the size of the rent they could collect from their peasants while guaranteeing peasants fairly secure legal rights to
their land.
In central France much of the land in the direct was held as a mitigated
form of servile tenure called taille re´elle in the Bourbonnais and bordelage in the
Nivernais. Though the people holding the land were free—indeed, they could be

nobles like the members of the de Las family—seigneurs deployed various controls to tie their tenants to their manor land in the direct. Land held on bordelage
in the region was impartible and could not be sold, exchanged, or disposed of
without the approval of the lord and usually involved heavy transaction fees
called lods et ventes. Those holding bordelage leases usually paid an entry fine
(entrage, tiers denier) plus a hefty fixed rent in money and in kind for the right
to use the property.21 The seigneur also enjoyed the right of repossession (retenue, retrait) over the land, which meant that he could substitute himself for any
potential purchaser of bordelage property put on the market. He thus could
acquire the land for whatever price the parties had agreed to even if it was well
below market values. The right of repossession could also be used to veto individuals the seigneur considered undesirable tenants. Significantly, according to
the feudal constraint known as mainmorte re´elle, land tenure also required that
potential heirs ordinarily be living on the property at the time of the leaseholder’s death. If not, the property reverted to the seigneur who held the land.
Even when nobles, like those in the de Las family, acquired land subject to bordelage, they ended up in the same precarious legal position as vulnerable peasants. As in Burgundy, mainmorte and lods et ventes became significant sources of
feudal revenue after 1500 since seigneurs could charge large entry fines whenever
land changed hands or demand exorbitant payments to not seize the land
because of a lack of direct heirs living on the property.22 At a time when France
was covered with uncultivated heaths, bushes, and trees, this kind of tenure was
especially common on marginal land that had to be cleared before cultivated,
perhaps because such work required a large labor force. Since seigneurs primarily used their forests for hunting in the early fifteenth century, they did not view
them as particularly valuable, so they did not hesitate to lease them to peasant
tenants when they needed additional income.23
Over time, especially with sixteenth-century inflation, the value of the
fixed dues from the customary sector declined. Simultaneously, the land in
the direct that earlier had been so difficult to lease was now extraordinarily valuable as parts of large, sometimes cleared estates.24 Seigneurs also began to
21. The entry fine was customarily fixed at 50 percent of the sale price in the Nivernais and usually
50 percent in the Bourbonnais. Cahiers de dole´ances from several Nivernais villages complained that the high
entry fines made it difficult if not impossible to sell land held on a bordelage lease. ADN, 1 L 162 (archives en
ligne), Cahier de dole´ances of Mhere and Marre´-et-Mont.
22. Antoine in “La seigneurie” argues that lods et ventes may have been the major source of income
from feudal land at the time of the Revolution. See also Bart, La liberte´ ou la terre, 11, 33–62, 79, 119–26, 161–

phrase disappears from the records by the middle of the sixteenth century. I have analyzed the leases found

find new uses for forests, especially for setting up foundries fueled by charcoal. Pastoral agriculture, fish farming, and viticulture also began to prosper
with France’s growing urban population and its concomitant demand for
meat, fish, and wine. Most important, land itself became desirable to many new
officeholders and merchants, as well as to aristocrats seeking further wealth and
prestige.25
Several historians have recognized that many nobles began to rethink the
organization of the seigneurie when fixed feudal dues declined in value as a
share of total revenue and as the absolute monarchy diminished the military
and judicial influence of aristocrats. As Florence Gauthier, summarizing the
results of this research, has argued, throughout the kingdom seigneurs sought to
increase the size of their reserves while shrinking the proportion of income from
the customary sector.26 Many historians have apparently assumed that when
aristocrats or bourgeois investors acquired peasant land, it was land that had
been or would be either absorbed into seigneurial reserves or reconstituted into
domains or estates that were no longer a part of aristocratic manors. A closer
examination of documents recording land transactions in the Bourbonnais and
the Nivernais, however, suggests that much of this land remained in seigneurial
directs and thus remained subject to feudal restrictions like bordelage and mainmorte.
Moreover, while customary law granted peasants fairly secure legal rights
to their land, it did not provide them with the economic means to hold on to
the property if nobles wanted it.27 Hence, despite important lacunae, varied
manuscripts reveal a whirl of activity in central France as nobles, bourgeois, and
wealthier peasants competed to acquire customary property during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, often leaving vulnerable peasants behind
as impoverished sharecroppers and day laborers. The economic effects of wars

25. Jean Jacquart in “La rente foncie`re” emphasized the significance of “prestige purchases.” This
may have been true of those acquiring land around France’s more prestigious cities in the seventeenth century but appears less true in more remote parts of France, especially during the eighteenth century. See also

27. To be sure, peasants continued to possess a significant amount of French farmland, especially in
mountainous regions like the Morvan, the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Massif Central; in areas that produced
wine, olive oil, hemp, vinegar, and other cash crops; and in areas where cottage industry was widespread. Yet
much of the land peasants held has been described as “microproperties” that were generally too small to
provide the peasant family with a subsistence living. For general discussions of landownership, see Gallet,

and taxes were probably most responsible for both the vulnerability of peasant
landholders and the monetarization of the rural economy that benefited nobles,
urban officeholders, and merchants at the expense of propertied peasants, who
acquired large debts both to pay taxes and to replenish livestock lost to tax collectors and marauding soldiers.28
It is also clear that seigneurs cleverly manipulated loans, often trapping
unsuspecting peasants by demanding repayment at inopportune times. In the
Bourbonnais, between 1600 and 1612 the seigneur des Gouttes loaned peasants
at least two thousand livres, while Anne de Saint-Hilaire, widow Meschatin,
loaned them fifteen hundred livres. From 1612 to 1640 Anne’s son Charles loaned
peasants an additional eight thousand livres, while the members of the Rollat
family loaned them at least eighteen hundred livres. Altogether in forty years three
seigneurial lines loaned peasants as much as 13,300 livres, which amounts to about
100 livres a year per seigneurial family, or somewhat less than it would have cost a
peasant to replace a team of oxen lost to tax collectors. Each of these families had
money to loan because they had earned income from their service to the king. It
also appears that they targeted loans so they could buy land in their own directs,
as well as in the directs of other seigneurs. Frequently they exercised the right of
repossession so they could acquire peasant land for a fraction of what it was
worth.29
Peasants recognized the dangers of borrowing money from seigneurs but
frequently had no choice. In 1665 they complained to the judges of the Grands
Jours d’Auvergne that nobles introduced new dues not present in earlier terriers,
the official registers that recorded such charges. Then they allowed arrears to
accumulate until the peasants could not repay the debt. Aristocrats, however,
did not need to create new dues to exploit their peasants. Esme de Las, lord of
several Nivernais manors, for example, allowed one tenant to pay no bordelage
dues for twenty-nine years and then called in all back payments in 1646. Since
his tenant, as expected, could not repay such a large sum, de Las seized his meadow and fields in Coulanges. More striking, a 1645 survey taken in the bailliage

29. Lelong, Le bocage Bourbonnais, 165–73, argues that peasants lost their land because they could
not repay their debts. He does not believe that either taxes or wars were that significant. He does not ask why
peasants needed to borrow such large amounts of money in the first place. I believe that other quantitative
and qualitative evidence challenges his conclusion that excessive warfare and taxation did not contribute significantly to the peasants’ loss of land. See Fitch, “Demographic and Economic Effects”; Hoffman, “Taxes

Table 1 summarizes the documents recording transfers of land in the
directs of the manors of Prye and Azy in the Nivernais. Before 1600 peasants
accounted for just under 50 percent of the land acquisitions made within the
manors. These were part of normal sales and purchases, as peasants aimed to
adjust the size of their holdings to meet family needs or perhaps increase their
acreage. But one can see the beginning of a larger transformation. Already the

impact of the Wars of Religion is evident. It is possible to show, by grouping the
data somewhat differently, that officeholders and merchants (classified as “bourgeois”) acquired over 50 percent of the land that changed hands during the wars
from 1562 to 1598, while the nobility acquired another 10 percent. In the next
fifty years, especially after the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War in 1618 and later
the wars of the Fronde, land transfers increased substantially; of greater significance, nobles, officeholders, and merchants now accounted for almost all of the
acquisitions, a trend that continued until the outbreak of revolution in 1789. As
a consequence of these transactions, nobles and bourgeois became responsible
for most of the new bordelage leases after 1649.31 Many of the new leaseholders
converted their bordelage leases to less restrictive tenures, but the numbers are
nonetheless remarkable: the nobility accounted for thirteen (36.1 percent) of the
bordelage leases acknowledged or accepted from 1650 to 1699, for four (15.4 percent) concluded between 1700 and 1749, and for twenty-five (73.5 percent)
recorded from 1750 until the eve of the French Revolution.32
Furthermore, as Shaffer has shown, nobles accounted for 81.8 percent and
the bourgeois (generally merchants and officeholders) for 17.6 percent of the
land acknowledged in the terrier of the fief of La Foreˆt in 1775, while they held
23.0 percent and 63.5 percent, respectively, of the land recorded in the terriers of
the seigneurial directs in the chaˆtellenie of Decize in 1774. Both of these areas,
like the manors of Prye and Azy, are in the rich lowlands of the Nivernais. Only
in the mountainous, forested, and rocky lands of the relatively isolated Morvan
did peasants hold 77.6 percent of the land in seigneurial directs in the years just
before the Revolution (1771–79). Even here the nobility held almost one-quarter
of the land in the directs of various seigneuries, probably as they sought to
exploit the region’s forests.33
As the data reveal, however peasants lost their land, their financial problems allowed seigneurs and others to acquire property in seigneurial directs, the
portion of the seigneurie on which seigneurs could collect only customarily
fixed dues and rents from their tenants. More problematic, seigneurs who
acquired such land might be subject to extra-economic exactions like entry
fines, corve´es (labor services), and forfeitures when property changed hands.
Seigneurs could also acquire land in their own directs, as many did. Unless they
acquired it through purchase, the exercise of seigneurial retenue, or subterfuge,

however, they did not own this land outright and could not do with it as they
liked, as they could with land held in their reserves.
These central French developments represent a small example of a larger
process by which seigneurs took land out of their directs to piece together
domains of seventy-five to two hundred or more hectares that could be enclosed
and leased for market-determined rents. As they deliberately shrunk their directs
and augmented the number of domains they held, they generally leased the land
to fermiers (managerial tenant farmers), who in turn sublet the land to me´tayers
or sharecroppers. This does not necessarily mean, however, that they held their
land as a modern proprietor, and the restrictions of bordelage often continued
to limit what nobles like those in the de Las family could do with their property.
As Jacques Lelong has demonstrated, one can find multiple examples of
nobles and bourgeois acquiring land subject to feudal constraints in the Bourbonnais. Jacques de la Brosse, for example, initiated a terrier for his seigneurie of
la Condemine near Buxie`res in bocage Bourbonnais in 1561. At this time few
nobles or bourgeois possessed land in his direct. Some changes are evident in the
subsequent terrier Charles de la Brosse, seigneur of la Condemine, prepared in
1622. Peasants and local villagers still held two-thirds of the direct, but nobles
had acquired 20 percent of its land. The documents are mute about motives, but
several prominent local nobles—Franc¸ois de Saint-Hilaire, seigneur of La Biotie`re; Jacques de Saint-Aubin, seigneur of Sarragousse; and Gilbert de la Loere,
lieutenant aux eaux et foreˆts—were now the seigneur’s tenants. De Saint-Hilaire
not only became de la Brosse’s tenant but married his sister, Louise. Was he
acquiring customary property and marrying the seigneur’s sister to acquire the
seigneurie? If so, he failed, as de Saint-Aubin’s daughter Julienne ended up with
it after she married Gabriel de Chabannes, who subsequently acquired the entire
seigneurie of la Condemine in February 1640. After her husband died, Julienne
sold the seigneurie to Jean de Villaine in 1675.34
If nobles choosing to become tenants of other seigneurs seems strange,
Jean de Villaine, the new seigneur, appears quite typical of upwardly mobile
officeholders. His son Nicolas, who succeeded him as seigneur of la Condemine
in 1665, was more involved with his position as pre´sident tre´sorier ge´ne´ral in the
ge´ne´ralite´ of Moulins and lived in Yzeure, not in the seigneurie’s chaˆteau. Perhaps he was less interested in the seigneurie, so he left only some mediocre lie`ves,
registers of payments made by tenants holding land in the direct. In this case the
lie`ves reveal that by the end of the seventeenth century few peasant tenures
34. Lelong, Le bocage Bourbonnais, 29–32. While historians disagree about whether or not de la Loere
was a noble when he acquired the land, he was almost certainly a noble when he died. See Gagnon, Ygrande,

remained in the seigneurie’s direct. Moreover, even before de Villaine had
become the seigneur, both the de la Brosse and de Chabannes families seem to
have acquired customary land in la Condemine’s direct to add to their reserves,
so the customary sector was about 20 percent smaller in 1700 than it had been in
1561. The lie`ves show that the de Saint-Hilaire family continued their acquisitions in the seigneurie’s direct, while M. de Dreuille, seigneur of la Lande and a
member of another noble family engrossing local land, had acquired additional
property within it. Altogether the nobility now held 30–35 percent of the direct,
as both de Saint-Hilaire and de Dreuille organized their lands as domains. Local
notables had also acquired land from peasants in the seigneurie, so by the eighteenth century peasants held no more than 10 percent of the land in the direct,
while the local bourgeoisie, including marchands-fermiers, now held 50 percent.
On the eve of the Revolution, la Condemine consisted of a dozen enclosed
domains in the hands of noble and bourgeois landowners, some of them still
paying feudal dues for their property.35
Another branch of the de Dreuille family acquired the neighboring
seigneurie of Issards through marriage in 1586. Peasants held most of the land in
the direct of the seigneurie in 1531, just as they once had held most of the land in
the direct of la Condemine. According to a terrier compiled that year, it appears
that most of the seigneurie’s land in the village of Gipcy was held as taille ree´lle
and included heavy corve´es, while its land in Autry was consolidated into relatively large properties by four peasant families who collectively occupied about
50 percent of the direct in that village. By the end of the seventeenth century Jacques de Dreuille had become the seigneur of Issards, and, according to his lie`ves,
much of the land in the direct had been consolidated into domains acquired by
notables as well as by de Dreuille himself. The Petitjean family made some of the
most significant acquisitions. Claude Petitjean, lieutenant en la pre´voˆte´ de Moulins, had already acquired le Landonnie`res in la Condemine by 1694 and was
calling himself seigneur of Landonnie`res when he acquired land in de Dreuille’s
direct in 1712. His brother Jacques also acquired a domain from a peasant family
in the direct in 1694.
Almost a century later Franc¸ois-Se´ne´taire de Dreuille—e
´cuyer, seigneur of
Issards and of Bloux—commissioned the next and last full terrier of the
seigneurie in 1775. By this time Claude Petitjean and others had purchased the

but they were kept irregularly. See Lelong, Le bocage Bourbonnais, 22–25, 29–32; Martin, Choses et gens du

enfranchisement of their land in the direct, turning their properties into freeholds, which reduced the size of the direct considerably. Additionally, over more
than a century hundreds of parcels had changed hands until the direct consisted
of multiple large domains held by local elites. Officers, notables, and marchands-fermiers now held 93 percent of the direct, while villagers and artisans
held the remaining 7 percent. Marchands-fermiers alone held about 52 percent of
the land and along with local bourgeois were responsible for almost all of
Issards’ feudal dues. Significantly, peasants, who had held nearly all the land
recorded in the earliest seigneurial documents, almost completely disappeared
from the eighteenth-century terrier.
36
As in bocage Bourbonnais, information on land held in the villages of
Chareil and Fourilles near Saint-Pourc¸ain-sur-Sioule in central Bourbonnais
reveals a decline in peasant landholding and in the size of seigneurial directs
from the early seventeenth century to 1789. Much of both villages belonged to
the Priory of Saint-Vincent in Chantelle in the late Middle Ages before the land
ended up in the hands of the Jesuits of Moulins in the seventeenth century. As
in bocage Bourbonnais, nobles had begun to acquire land in the seigneurie’s
direct. By the late eighteenth century they held 61 percent of the land in the direct
of Chareil and 41 percent in the direct of Fourilles. Several other phenomena are
apparent in tables 2 and 3, which summarize hundreds of land transactions over
two centuries after the initial terrier was constructed in the early seventeenth
century. As was true in most of the region, by 1770 peasants collectively lost
most of the land they once held in the direct, especially in Chareil, where they
possessed less than a quarter of what they held in 1618. Superficially, peasants
seemed to do better in Fourilles, but the data on this village are misleading,
since so much of the direct had disappeared by this time. As they acquired land,

many nobles removed it from the direct through enfranchisements, especially in
Fourilles. The best-case scenario, then, is that peasants may have held slightly
under half of what they farmed in the early seventeenth century.37
Other examples can be found in what is now the Bourbonnais, Nivernais,
and Brionnais. The Meschatin family, seigneurs of la Faye in the Bourbonnais,
engaged in fifty transactions to acquire land, thirty-nine in their own direct and
eleven in neighboring seigneuries. The seigneur of Chassy and ambassador to
Naples, Regnault-Ce´sar-Louis de Choiseul-Praslin, and his ancestors created
nine domains in the Nivernais of between forty-five and eighty hectares from
land they bought from peasant families. The Charry des Gouttes family
engrossed enough land in the direct of their seigneurie to leave the naval captain
and marquis Jean-Antoine Charry des Gouttes with at least nine domains, as
well as other properties.38 All of these families had powerful court connections;
they were neither impoverished rural nobles acquiring peasant property to survive nor acquisitive bourgeois buying land to obtain noble status.
Similarly, families holding property and seigneuries near Saint-Benind’Azy in the Nivernais constantly engaged in transactions that made them the
bordelage tenants of other seigneurs by acquiring land, often with forges or
meadows, to engross large domains.39 From all land transactions that mentioned Michel de Las, Louise de Las’s grandfather, it is evident that the seigneur
of Valotte emphasized the acquisition of forests, forges, and mines.40 When his

son Louis-Henri de Las married Catherine-Louise Cordier de Launay in 1734, he
inherited land in Azy, Valotte, Micoge (les Gamards), and la Haute-Court that
included several domains his father and grandfather had engrossed and
enclosed. In itemizing his property, the younger de Las noted that his vast
estates now included land in directs from which he could collect feudal dues,
which with other rents brought in 1,800 livres; seven domains let to sharecroppers with a revenue valued at 500 livres each (for a total of 3,500 livres); an iron
foundry, two large forges, and a small forge, collectively worth 2,500 livres; 3,100
arpens of forests worth 4,500 livres; and a tile-making operation worth 15,300
livres (fig. 2). The capital equipment, livestock, and mines associated with
the forges and the foundry were estimated as worth sixty thousand livres.
The inventory thus reveals that feudal dues now represented only a small component of the value of de Las’s estate.41 Indeed, if one considers the fines

41. ADN, 2 F 156. The figure does not take into account ten thousand livres worth of movable property that included imported porcelain from China, a cabinet of books, tapestries, and other items. It also
does not include the family properties in Cheraux and Teraille worth ten thousand livres that Louis-Henri
would inherit after the deaths of his parents, including three domains, livestock, vineyards, dıˆmes, and forests. Michel de Las and Catherine Filsjean, his wife, could collect some feudal dues from this land, but they
were not itemized in the documents. Louis-Henri’s inheritance also did not include his father’s recent acquisitions of Prye and Imphy, which went to his younger brother, Jean-Baptiste-Claude Bernard de Las, Louise
de Las’s father. My estimate of the percentage of feudal dues in the value of Louis-Henri’s estate might be
low, and it is clear that seigneurial dues constituted much more of an aristocrat’s income in some places
(Goldsmith, Lordship in France, 5, 228). Jacques Jarriot and Andre´ Paris estimated that seigneurial dues

the family paid to keep bordelage leases after Louis-Henri de Las died, they
could very well have paid more in feudal dues and entry fines than they collected
from their tenants.
Finally, in the Brionnais, adjacent to the Bourbonnais, Jacques Du Claux,
seigneur of l’Etoile, took advantage of the seventeenth-century crisis in peasant
fortunes to engross and enclose domains. He too acquired land in his direct,
including valuable forests and meadows, which he added to his reserve. Much
like English landlords, he fired fermiers who he believed were not bringing in
enough revenues, especially from cattle fattening.42
When they acquired land in their own directs, most of these seigneurs
abandoned the traditional collection of customarily fixed feudal dues and
instead leased their newly engrossed and enclosed domains to fermiers. Feudal
dues remained an essential component of noble incomes, but seigneurs were
increasingly moving toward market-based rents collected from fermiers who
then sublet land to propertyless sharecroppers, who carried out almost all agricultural work on the farms. For Pierre de Saint-Jacob, the introduction of these
fermiers into the seigneurie constituted “one of the largest events in the agrarian
history and the social history of the century.”43
Because they could shift costs to these fermiers and sharecroppers, landlords apparently considered the acquisition of peasant property, even if encumbered by feudal constraints, a good investment, and contemporary observers
recognized how fiscal policies made the land particularly valuable to tax-exempt
aristocrats. As mentioned earlier, aristocrats were especially active in acquiring
peasant land during the first half of the seventeenth century when wars and
taxes robbed peasants of meager resources.44 Since taxes in the ge´ne´ralite´ of
Moulins increased by a whopping 291 percent from 1607 to 1647, it appears that
the state, through its tax structure, helped seigneurs create monopolistic quasicapitalist markets in land. As marshal Se´bastien Le Prestre de Vauban demonstrated in 1707 after studying taxes and landownership in the Nivernais and
other parts of France, the tax exemptions of nobles and their fermiers raised the
value of the privileged investors’ property relative to land held by taxpaying
peasants, which generally dropped in price every time the taille or property tax
was raised. For Philip T. Hoffman, the fact that the monarchy allowed the
constituted about 10 percent of the revenue of most Nivernais nobles who organized their land into domains
(“Vitalite´ du Nivernais,” 251–53).

nobility to preserve their tax exemptions while constantly raising the taille on
everyone else effectively “drove peasant owners out of business.”45
Even though land in seigneurial directs was more valuable to them than to
peasants because of royal tax policies, nobles remained responsible for the payment of whatever feudal dues were owed on lands they possessed. They sometimes tried to enfranchise or eliminate bordelage restrictions on their land, but
Jean Bart believed that enfranchisements were rare in Burgundy, although they
might have been more common in the Bourbonnais and parts of the Nivernais.46 Regardless, when forced to pay feudal dues, tenants could owe a lot to
other lords. In 1755 Charry des Gouttes owed dues worth seventy-five livres and
sixteen boisseaux of rye to the priests of Vaumas and Thionne, to the abbot of
Sept-Fonds, and to the seigneur of Chaˆtelperron, while in 1786 Louise de Las’s
husband, now the marquis du Bourg de Bozas, owed over 713 livres to the priest
of Mousseaux-sur-Azy for thirteen years of bordelage charges. Many of the new
noble and bourgeois landholders of property held in the customary sector of the
chaˆtellenie ducale of Bourbon paid the largest share of the redevances owed to
the prince de Conde´ at the end of the eighteenth century (table 4). They paid a

46. I identified fifty-one cases where enfranchisements were granted during the seventeenth century
in the small region of Vitry in la Sologne Bourbonnais in ADN, 1 F 63–1 F 67, 1 F 85. Bart believes there were
at most thirty-nine enfranchisements in Burgundy during the seventeenth century and at most twenty-eight
in the eighteenth century (La liberte´ ou la terre, 179–85). Jean Chiffre believes enfranchisements were necessary if peasants wanted to sell their land (Les aspects ge´ographiques, 112–18). My sense is that bordelage did
not prevent tenants from selling their property but may have limited those willing to buy it to fairly substantial noble and bourgeois families.

similar proportion of feudal dues in Fourilles and Chareil, while nobles, clergy,
and bourgeois collectively paid approximately 43 percent of the dues owed to
Louis-Franc¸ois Depaule, marquis of Soudeilles, count and baron of Druy in the
Nivernais.47
If they held bordelage leases, seigneurs could also be subject to mainmorte,
as was Jean-Marie Sallonier, seigneur of Montagne in the Nivernais. When his
tenant, Sallonier, died without coresident heirs in 1781, Henri de SaulxTavannes, baron of Vitry and lord of Montigny, exercised his right to confiscate
Sallonier’s properties at Couloise. A similar problem confronted Antoine Bourneuf on the death of his older brother Claude, greffier au bailliage of Che´zelles
and Dompierre, lieutenant en bailliage of Garnat, and notary in Beaulon. Even
though the two brothers had bought the property together, the seigneur of
Maupertuis could now “inherit” the domain of Les Berliers because Antoine
was not living with Claude when he died. Antoine, however, was able to pay the
seigneur 150 livres not to exercise his right to seize the domain.48 Bourneuf got
off easy. In 1755 it cost Jeanne-Marie du Bourg, sister-in-law of Louis-Henri de
Las, who died without direct heirs, eight thousand livres to persuade seigneur
Andras de Marcy to allow her minor son Michel-Mathieu to inherit his uncle’s
land in Cougny held subject to bordelage. But this settlement did not prevent
Andras de Marcy and others from again claiming the family’s possessions, this
time in Segoule and Deux-Villes, in 1768 when Michel-Mathieu de Las too died
without coresident heirs.49
While wealthy individuals could often circumvent bordelage restrictions
by paying additional fees, seigneurs often “inherited” the family patrimony of
peasants who died without coresident heirs or divided or sold their land without
the lord’s permission. Peasants recognized the risks, and many historians have
argued that this specific tenure led local inhabitants to form the large complex
agricultural communaute´s or joint families found in central France.50

50. The connection between bordelage and the formation of complex households was almost taken
as a given in traditional legal and historical work on the region. Recent studies by Shaffer, Chiffre, and Bernard Derouet challenge the direct relationship but nonetheless note that the families were common where
this tenurial form prevailed. Complicating the traditional argument is the fact that complex families seemed
even more prevalent in the region when me´tayage or sharecropping became the dominant means of exploiting the land after peasants lost any property rights to it. See Shaffer, Family and Farm; Chiffre, Les aspects
ge´ographiques; and Derouet, “La terre, la personne et le contrat.”

Undoubtedly, nobles understood the risks as well, but dedicated to military service outside the region, they may have been even more likely to die away from
their estates.
Bordelage/taille re´elle and mainmorte therefore continued to impede the
movement toward complete capitalist property rights, making the continued
existence of these tenures a serious complaint in regional cahiers de dole´ances
compiled in 1789. As the Third Estate of Neuffontaines in the Nivernais protested, “This odious measure [bordelage] has no other end, in the case of the
death of the proprietor, than to despoil the legitimate heirs of the heritages and
property belonging to them by the rights of blood ties. . . . Families are often
reduced to a life of begging because of it.”51 Obviously, powerful tenants like
Antoine Bourneuf and Louise de Las did not have to worry about becoming
beggars, but the complexities bordelage introduced into many business transactions had other widespread ramifications. For instance, Andre´ Chastignier, an
ironmaster and fermier of Azy who had leased his forges from Michel-Mathieu
de Las, feared that he would lose all his investments in his property when seigneur Andras de Marcy attempted to confiscate forges and land subject to bordelage/mainmorte. Chastignier too had no choice but to launch a bitter lawsuit
against the seigneur.52
It is tempting to argue that, regardless of fluid, capitalist-like markets for
land, feudal tenures hampered capitalist development in central France because
of their restrictions on what the aristocracy and bourgeoisie (both as owners
and as fermiers) could do with their land. Yet the evidence is much more ambiguous. Many of these “aristocratic serfs” specifically invested in pasture, vines,
and forests with commercial value, while others acquired foundries and iron
mills and targeted land with forest and water rights. The de Las family, for
example, seemed to have acquired land rich in iron ore from around SaintBenin-d’Azy, where they either established or took over iron foundries and
forges in Azy, Valotte, les Gamards, la Guesne (Vannay), and Paillot. The forge
at Valotte was among the few authorized to engage in production for the monarchy during the seventeenth century, and it appeared to be a supplier for the
large factory complex that Pierre Babaud de la Chaussade had developed to produce anchors in the Nivernais during Louis XIV’s wars. It appears that by 1770
the family had acquired one of its most significant industrial assets, the collection of iron mills in Imphy.53

53. Michel de Las, Louise’s grandfather, was officially recorded as the seigneur of Prye, Imphy, and
other properties on March 10, 1723. He left Prye and Imphy to Louise’s father, Jean-Baptiste de Las, while
leaving what was then believed to be the most valuable property in his estate to Jean-Baptiste’s older brother,

Collectively, then, seigneurs like those in the de Las family seem to have
engrossed hayfields and land with iron seams, mines, forests, and forges by buying up property held in seigneurial directs and subject to all kinds of feudal
restrictions. Though compelled to pay feudal dues, aristocrats (and bourgeois
landowners) leased hayfields to fermiers or sharecroppers for market-based
rents, while they exploited their mines, forests, and forges on a capitalist-like
basis, mostly by leasing them to fermiers and ironmasters. In these cases they
could force their tenants to pay their dues and entry fines. These tenants, in
turn, could also make sharecroppers carry out any required corve´es or labor services while inventing new corve´es of their own, such as forcing tenants to drag
logs or haul water or charcoal for their industrial establishments—a system that
led to what one historian described as “farms and forges [that] were mutually
sustaining, semi-integrated enterprises.”54
Once notables held the land, they could use it for commercial or industrial
purposes. The de Dreuilles were among the first to introduce specialized cattle
breeds for commercial veal production in the Bourbonnais; land in the seigneuries of la Condemine and Issards would become important for their forests and
mines. Members of the de Las family contributed to the production of anchors
for the navy and the Compagnie des Indes. To fully exploit their lands, they campaigned for better roads and canals and engaged in countless new projects to
increase production and enhance their forges’ profitability, practices that drew
multiple lawsuits from both their industrial rivals and their rural neighbors.55
Wood from the Nivernais was sold in Paris and in French Atlantic ports; iron
ore was exported to the Germanies. Producers had to get the anchors to
Louis-Henri. The property in Prye and Imphy was joined to the family’s holdings in Azy again with Louise’s
inheritances from her brother and later her mother. In 1812 Jean-Godefroy Legoube, Louise de Las’s agent,
stated that “everyone knows that Dame Du Bourg’s forges produced anchors for the navy before the imperial
forges at Gue´rigny and that they manufactured them concurrently with those [produced] in Cosne” (quoted
in Thuillier, Economie et socie´te´, 321). On the de Las family, see ADN, 2 F 419, 2 F 431; Masse, Communes
extra muros, 240–63; and Drouillet, Drouillet, and Drouillet, Histoire de Saint-Benin-d’Azy, 127–74. On Pierre

shipyards in and near Nantes on the Atlantic coast, which was never easy, since
their waterway to the west, the Loire, could dry up in the summer and freeze in
the winter. Their contracts depended on the navy and contact with court favorites, as well as local entrepreneurs. Yet untimely deaths that allowed land to
revert to other seigneurs because of feudal constraints still threatened productive activity.56
Despite considerable turmoil, much of this insecurity in production vanished with the Revolution. Widowed in 1788, Louise de Las, now calling herself
widow Dubourg, managed to maintain exclusive control of her family’s vast
estates with their valuable foundries and forges. Her numerous livestock leases
suggest her involvement in making agricultural decisions as well. Though she
complained that she “was nearly ruined by the Revolution,” she also bought
more religious property sold as “national lands” than anyone else in the district
of Nevers. She simultaneously bought a lot of property in private land markets
to enhance her holdings in and around Imphy. At one point she thought her life
might be in danger when Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and other radical revolutionaries attacked her as a member of the new “aristocracy” of industrialists and
factory masters. Though maybe the wealthiest person in the Nivernais and
chased away from her home temporarily, she somehow escaped the guillotine by
seeking refuge in Paris. Forced to accept inflated, almost worthless, assignats
as payment for her government contracts, widow Dubourg protested that the
requisitions and the monetary policies of the revolutionary governments were
“destroying industry.” Nonetheless she survived, in the end owning all of her
land and factories free and clear thanks to revolutionary legislation. To cut
costs, she decided to run Imphy herself for a number of years before eventually
leasing it in 1815 for twenty years to a group of investors who would ultimately
incorporate the Imphy complex into the Socie´te´ Anonyme de CommentryFourchambault et Decazeville, one of the largest industrial companies in nineteenth-century France. She also sold part of what she believed were her less
valuable holdings for over two million livres to Le´onar Brie`re, son of industrialist Pierre Brie`re, who had directed industrial operations for the count of Artois,
the king’s brother and future king Charles X. Whether she intended to or not,
while guarding the family chaˆteau at Prye and the factories in Imphy, widow
Dubourg placed much of what she owned in the hands of a dynamic family.
This family would develop both the region’s agriculture and its industry during

the early nineteenth century as prominent aristocrats after Brie`re arranged a
marriage between his daughter Rose-Ame´lie and noble Denys Benoist (later
Benoist d’Azy). Louise de Las also seems to have arranged a marriage between
her daughter Henriette-Marie and Louis-Pierre-Etienne Berthier, who himself
was the product of an arranged marriage between Etienne-Franc¸ois BerthierBizy, the son of an industrial aristocrat, and Louise-Rose Babaud de la Chaussade, daughter of the most prominent Nivernais industrialist, Pierre Babaud de
la Chaussade. The histories of these families—the de Lases/du Bourgs, the
Brie`res/Benoists, and the Berthier-Bizys/Babaud de la Chaussades—suggest an
expanded notion of aristocratic identification that included both traditional
marital alliances and new visions of industrial entrepreneurship.57
In addition to the evidence of commercial and industrial activity indicated
in these rural case studies, a different kind of evidence, offered by several major
bourgeois and aristocratic observers who took a keen interest in economic
development in central France, indicates that the regional economy might have
been progressing because seigneurs had acquired peasant property from other
seigneurs. Almost all of them, beginning with Jean-Marie Roland de la Platie`re
in 1769, noted that central French land was consolidated into very large domains
in the hands of a few rich individuals, who could have invested in agriculture
but were more interested in developing industry. Roland added that in most
places three or four seigneurs owned all the land in estates that sometimes
encompassed whole villages. Hence peasants would work in the forges, mines,
and subsidiary industries rather than in agriculture, because farming was too
insecure and paid too little. As Roland observed, the exploitation of cultivators
and workers was so intense that it was not surprising that poor people constantly complained about labor requirements (corve´es).58
The English agronomist Arthur Young praised the enclosed farms he
observed in la Sologne Bourbonnais in August 1789. He ended up in the region
in the midst of multiple peasant uprisings related to the “Great Fear,” the

widespread rural panics and revolts that ultimately culminated in the “night of
August 4,” when the nobility, at least nominally, renounced their feudal rights
and privileges. There is no question that the threat of peasant violence frightened this Englishman, yet he remained an acute observer of local agricultural
conditions. While Young believed that the region’s agriculture was appalling
because sharecroppers were too poor to invest in improvements, he found most
buildings and roads in excellent shape. He met Charry des Gouttes and considered buying his attractive seigneurie at Riaux, which included seigneurial courts,
much livestock, multiple ponds that yielded a regular revenue, and nine
domains leased to sharecroppers whom he significantly described as “tenants at
will.” The only reason Young resisted this appealing offer was “the state of the
government—the possibility that the leaders of the Paris democracy might in
their wisdom abolish property as well as rank.”59
Jean-Claude Flamen d’Assigny, a youthful French aristocrat who had studied agriculture in England, came to many of the same conclusions that Young
did: land in central France was cheap, very improvable, and, most important,
already engrossed and enclosed in large domains. Unlike Young, he subsequently
bought a central French seigneurie in Saint-Jean-aux-Amognes, close if not in
the former seigneurie of Azy, where he established a model farm after 1811. To
promote agricultural progress, he kept a journal on regional developments
wherein he noted small improvements—a field of clover here and there, the
introduction of cattle to be fattened from the Charolais or Brionnais, and experiments raising merino sheep from Spain. But he found no sustained improvements in cultivation like those he had marveled at in England.60
In contrast, when one examines regional parish-level cahiers de dole´ances
and petitions to the feudal committees of the Constituent and Legislative
Assemblies in the early years of the French Revolution, the anger against nobles,
fermiers, and those who had engrossed domains or who had acquired forests
suggests that capitalism in the countryside had already ravished village communities. This is not the capitalism one usually thinks of; rather, it was an economic
system that Georges Lefebvre described as “capitalism . . . under the cover of
feudal rights.”61 Accordingly, parish cahiers from the Nivernais and the bailliage
of Autun, which included a substantial part of the Nivernais, are replete with
complaints about feudalism but are even more adamant in their critique of the
unbridled capitalism that recent changes had let loose in the countryside. Villagers objected to the exploitation of fermiers, the fact that sharecroppers had to

pay all feudal dues and taxes, and the deprivations caused by the privatization
and commercial exploitation of forests.62
Some village cahiers were quite specific about exactly what these changes
meant for ordinary peasants. As the villagers of la Collancelle, not far from the
manors of Prye and Azy, explained, “The largest portion of land in the parish
(approximately three-quarters) is possessed by the seigneurs,” adding that “the
small amount of good land which produced the best-quality grain was dug up
for the canal of Chaˆtillon.” They complained that the property the seigneurs
held was “necessarily the best, because, according to their terriers, they have with
each sale the odious right of repossession [retenue], and in spite of all the repossessions that have [been] made since time immemorial, we still carry [the burden] of all the taxes in the parish and the seigneur is exempt from them.” Even
worse, what little land they held was subject to bordelage. Their list of grievances
concluded by noting that most of their pasture was razed to construct the canal.
And while most of the parish was covered in forests, which could be used to
graze pigs and goats, the seigneurs used their prerogatives over forests to deprive
them of grazing rights.63 The peasants of la Collancelle appear thoroughly aware
of the way aristocrats were using feudal privileges to acquire land and resources.
They also seemed to recognize that what some historians would later call centralized surplus extraction—in the form of state taxation—may have been
devouring itself and them at the end of the Old Regime. As they explained, every
time a tax-exempt noble acquired the property of a taxpaying peasant, fewer
impoverished people were left to pay the same amount of taxes previously
owed. They were not just protesting the unequal tax burden; they were also
tying it to the process by which nobles acquired land in directs through their use
of feudal rights and privileges.
The parishioners of what is now Mouron-sur-Yonne, not far from la Collancelle, similarly complained that seigneurs and ecclesiastics owned all of the
village’s land, while peasants possessed nothing. They too grumbled that seigneurs prevented them from using forests to keep a cow or goat, even depriving
them of the right to fish in the Yonne. While conceding that the state needed

are alluding to the arbitrariness of tax collection in Old Regime France. Officials estimated how much taxes
should come from land in the finage of the village and then divided it up among those included on tax rolls.
If tax-exempt individuals held the land, they were not included. The exact process of how tax collection disadvantaged peasants when privileged individuals acquired land in village directs is plainly spelled out in

money, they insisted that the real problem in France was that poor and landless
people were dying of hunger in the countryside because they lacked the means
to support themselves.64
Peasants from Ruages, north of Corbigny, were especially vocal in complaining about triage, the practice by which seigneurs could annex one-third of
the communal forests as their own. This meant that peasants who forty years
earlier could have kept five or six horses could no longer keep any. More important, they explained, they were once able to fatten 150 cattle but now could
barely nurture the 30 necessary for cultivation. Similar complaints about the loss
of pasture and access to forests were echoed in other regional cahiers.
65
The status, confiscation, and regulation of forests alluded to in the peasant
cahiers de dole´ances are directly related to aristocratic land acquisitions in the
Bourbonnais and the Nivernais (and in much of France). As wood became
increasingly significant to fuel forges and heat homes in France’s larger cities,
seigneurial and ecclesiastical control over forests expanded during the same period in which peasants lost their land. By the end of the seventeenth century the
nobility and the church (2 percent of the population) controlled virtually all
commercially viable forests in France. Once they viewed forests as a profitable
resource, they no longer wanted peasants’ pigs and goats grazing in them, as
had been allowed in the past.66 Hence they systematically revoked peasant use
rights to their woods every way they could. When tax-exempt nobles and ecclesiastics monopolized timberland, they deprived peasants of pasture, making it
even more difficult for them to produce dairy products often used to pay their
taxes. At some level the king recognized the problem, and in the late seventeenth
century the monarchy attempted to protect its peasant tax base by preserving
some communal rights in village forests. Unfortunately for the state treasury
and the embattled peasantry, the royal ordinances of 1667 and 1669 only slowed
the seigneurial acquisition of this valuable resource.67

65. Ibid., Cahier de dole´ances of Ruages. While peasant complaints focused on triage, it was only one
of a number of similar practices seigneurs used to acquire forests. By the eighteenth century seigneurs were
far more likely to demand sections of forests for their own use (cantonment), which allowed them to claim
as much as two-thirds of the coveted forests. They also demanded one-third of the revenue produced by the
third of the forests left to communities. These and similar practices were typically referred to as triage in
popular rhetoric. These are only the official ways in which seigneurs used feudal rights to claim village
resources. They also frequently released peasants from the constraint of mainmorte and other obligations in
return for relinquishing forest rights. See Goldsmith, Lordship in France, 23–32; Deve`ze, “Les foreˆts franc¸aises,” 242–44; and Plaisance, “La re´partition des foreˆts communales.”

Moreover, as naval demands for central French timber and anchors
exploded during the Seven Years’ War and the American Revolution, prices for
wood and iron products rose steeply. This demand induced nobles—including
members of the de Las family—to acquire woodlands and rights to the water
they needed to power their anchor-making machinery. These aristocrats did not
just acquire land; they also procured the opportunity to exploit it by employing
sharecroppers, which offered many additional advantages. Petitions to various
revolutionary committees echoed peasant complaints found in the parish cahiers
de dole´ances and added some new ones about what villagers saw as recent episodes of exploitation. Sharecroppers from the region that included the manors
of Prye and Azy, for example, protested against landowners’ fermiers, who
forced them to haul wood and whatever else they needed transported. Around
the same time the Socie´te´ Populaire of nearby Brutus Le Magnanime (SaintPierre-le-Mouˆtier) charged that fermiers, who were speculating in small iron
foundries and also involved in logging, were ruining agriculture in the region.
As the popular society explained, these fermiers invested in industrial activities
while forcing sharecroppers to haul lumber and charcoal as part of their corve´es.
Thus the sharecroppers’ poorly nourished draft stock, barely able to carry out
fieldwork, were now completely exhausted by the excessive haulage. Nivernais
peasants were not alone in complaining about seigneurial manipulation of forest rights and corve´es. Cahiers from parishes in the Franche-Comte´ (where serfdom was more intense and industrialization more advanced) not only identified
problems with seigneurial and ecclesiastical monopolies of woodlands but also
demanded the end of factories (usines) and forges.68
Simultaneously, peasants pleaded for the end of feudal privileges and
mainmorte. Reflecting the overall arguments of the region, Nivernais peasants
felt so “absolutely discouraged” by the burdens of mainmorte that they had no
incentives to improve agriculture. Meanwhile, sharecroppers described fermiers
as “cancers on agriculture” since they monopolized land to fatten cattle while
landless sharecroppers were starving.69

Consequently, while capitalism may not have been completely present in
the countryside, feudalism was nonetheless reshaped by the capitalist tendencies
within it. Perhaps Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie described it best when he wrote,
“Far from competing with each other, feudalism and capitalism lent each other
a hand.”70 The advantage of seigneurial privileges in cornering the resources
necessary for success in new industrial enterprises—especially the ability to
demand corve´es from sharecroppers and bordelage tenants—breathed new life
into what heretofore appeared to be a decaying feudal system.71 Most important, in pursuing the acquisition of land, entrepreneurial nobles frequently
became “aristocratic serfs” in markets where land itself was a commodity still
governed by the vestiges of feudalism. These aristocrats may not have liked the
situation, but they were more than willing to accept the consequences of bordelage, mainmorte, and feudal dues while using their feudal privileges to acquire
vast estates. In this way they and their fermiers could profit from industries as
well as agriculture, largely at the expense of an increasingly embittered and landless peasantry. The de Las family, for example, cornered land and forests along
the Ixeure to supply Imphy, while Babaud de la Chaussade systematically bought
up everything along the Nie`vre to furnish his factories in Cosne and Gue´rigny.
Although in the eighteenth century industrial development in this region
was relatively limited, it began to blossom in the early nineteenth century. It is
difficult to say what impact the abolition of feudalism might have had on this
region’s transformation after 1815. Ironically, however, because they probably
paid most of the feudal dues, aristocrats like Louise de Las, as well as bourgeois
landowners, were often among the beneficiaries, the ones who made substantial
windfall profits, when revolutionary legislation ended the “feudal regime” in all
of its forms.72
Yet there is only scant evidence that aristocrats themselves wanted to do
away with these dues or even bordelage/taille ree´lle and mainmorte. At most 14
percent of noble cahiers de dole´ances called for ending feudal dues or dıˆmes, the
so-called tenth of the harvest claimed by ecclesiastical seigneurs to support the
costs of the church.73 Moreover, as Thierry Bressan has demonstrated, while the

opposition to dıˆmes and tithes where ecclesiastics collected them, primarily in the south and where vineyards
prevailed in the north. Especially in the south nobles and bourgeois frequently joined peasants in opposing
them. In central France it seems that outright protests were rare, but some of the many lawsuits and

monarchy attempted to legislate the end of mainmorte in its edict of August 8,
1779, most nobles opposed it, especially in areas where it was important, such as
the Nivernais and Franche-Comte´. One can also find petitions from both seigneurs and fermiers complaining about their potential loss of property if these
dues should be abolished. Indeed, seigneurial ideas about what constituted
“property” in arguing to maintain their dues shaped much of the discourse
about this topic during the earliest years of the Revolution (1789–92). At this
time even some of the most market-oriented seigneurs could not fathom a
world without feudal privileges or dıˆmes. Antoine Destutt de Tracy, for example,
owned most of the land in the Bourbonnais village of Paray-le-Fre´sil. He also
mortgaged his rural holdings to invest in property in Paris, fancied himself an
economist, published his own treatise on political economy with the aid of Thomas Jefferson, and encouraged his son Victor to become one of the earliest agricultural improvers in the region. Yet while he publicly supported abolishing the
dıˆmes in late 1789, Destutt de Tracy also advocated allowing the landlord to
increase his tenant’s rent by the amount of the dıˆmes they no longer had to pay.
Such a measure, he argued, would ensure that peasants supported parish priests,
but he raised no complaints when, much to the despair of sharecroppers, the
state took over support of the clergy while legally allowing landowners to continue to pocket the abolished dıˆmes according to a law passed on December 1,
1790.74
In conclusion, this analysis of land acquisitions suggests the difficulties
of labeling rural seigneurs of central France as either entrepreneurial nobles
or aristocratic serfs. There is little doubt that some nobles, like Louise de Las,
imagined themselves as modern entrepreneurs who carefully calculated the costs
and benefits of business decisions; her goal was to improve the profitability of
her factories. At the same time, no matter how problematic some feudal customs
were in restricting inheritance rights, most seigneurs, including Louise de Las,
were still eager to use their feudal prerogatives to more effectively monopolize
land, water, charcoal, coal, labor, and forests. As others have demonstrated for
settlements over unpaid dues may have been a consequence of noble and bourgeois “strikes” against paying
them. For opposition to the dıˆmes in southern France, see Freˆche, Toulouse et la re´gion Midi-Pyre´ne´es, 536–
45; Rives, Dıˆme et socie´te´, 145–62; and Goldsmith, Lordship in France, 107–210. On possible “strikes” against
feudal dues or corve´es, see Lelong, Le bocage Bourbonnais, 121–32; Baron, “Histoire de Marcy avant la Re´volution”; and Dupieux, “Les impoˆts.”

other parts of France, forges—like banal mills, the right to carry a sword, and
weathervanes—were viewed as simply another feudal privilege, a benefit of having a seigneurie with forests and water rights as well as exemption from taxation.75 Thus, as the battles over Louise de Las’s inheritance show, by the late
eighteenth century rural aristocratic families were blending new kinds of industry with traditional forms of agriculture; they also increasingly deprived peasants of land and grazing rights, while their fermiers reintroduced feudal labor
requirements such as corve´es under the guise of market-based sharecropping
contracts. Such practices need to be considered in analyzing the rise of capitalism and industrialization in France. They also help explain the intense hostility
of peasants toward seigneurs and their fermiers evident in the countryside on
the eve of the French Revolution.</p>
