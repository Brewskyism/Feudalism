<p>Migration, Mobility, and Spatial
Segregation: Freedom of Movement
as Equal Opportunity
Michael Ball-Blakely
University of Washington
Abstract: Many supporters of open borders argue that restrictions on
immigration are unjust in part because they undermine equal opportunity. Borders prevent the globally least-advantaged from pursuing
desirable opportunities abroad, cementing arbitrary facts about birth and
citizenship. In this paper I advance an argument from equal opportunity
to global freedom of movement. In addition to preventing people from
pursuing desirable opportunities, borders also create a prone, segregated
population that can be dominated and exploited. Restrictions on mobility
do not just trap people in bad opportunity sets—they help create bad
opportunities by isolating the negative externalities of production and
foreign policy. Freedom of movement can play a vital role in spreading
risks and burdens, incentivizing their mitigation. Using an analysis of
feudalism, segregation, and the transnational economy, I illustrate the
centrality of space and mobility, showing why freedom of movement
is a necessary tool for preventing political and economic oppression.
Introduction1
Equality of opportunity (EO) has become a major fulcrum in the debate
over immigration. Joseph Carens has led the push for more open borders, arguing that restrictions on mobility create unjust divisions in life
prospects, thereby violating a global principle of EO.2
 In response, critics
have argued that Carens misunderstands the value of EO, ignoring salient differences between the domestic and global practices.

In this paper I seek to vindicate Carens’s conclusion, putting it on
firmer ground within liberal political philosophy. In order to do so I offer
an extended analysis of EO. The goal of EO is not simply eliminating the
effects of luck on life chances. Instead, I argue that securing EO spreads
risks and negative externalities across those participating in, and affected
by, an economic practice.
John Rawls identified two ways that opportunities might be unequal:
1) discrimination preventing people from getting positions for which they
are qualified and 2) unequal education and training leaving people without the ability to develop their talents. When opportunities are unequal
in these ways, socioeconomic positions become inherited. This has two
implications. First, it unjustly precludes people—on the basis of group
membership—from enjoying the benefits of a system of cooperation.
Second, when people in the worst positions are segregated based on
group membership, there is little incentive to improve their pay, workplace conditions, or benefits. Roosevelt’s New Deal was tailored to exclude southern Black workers by excluding the jobs in sectors where they
were predominant—farmworkers and domestic workers.3
 Today, the
workplace conditions for farm and slaughterhouse workers are partially
a product of the precarity of the migrants filling these positions.
Focusing on the second problem with unequal opportunities, spatial
segregation and restrictions on mobility can be shown to be similarly
unjust. They contribute to an unequal distribution of opportunities and
incentivize a clustering of costs and risks in marginalized communities.
This has significant implications for migration. The spatial segregation of
labor—generated by the current era of transnational capitalism and protected by the current regime of border control—helps situate the worst
effects of a transnational economy there rather than here, negatively impacting them and not us.
Though they are presented as neutral in their exclusion, borders are
selectively enforced. Borders for transnational corporations (TNCs) are
porous, designed to facilitate their movement. Affluent, skilled, and white
migrants face relatively relaxed borders, with many countries positively
competing for them. However, citizens of low-income countries—particularly poor people of color—find either all-but impenetrable borders or
admission only through restrictive (and exploitative) temporary worker
programs or illicit entry. This asymmetry in mobility exacerbates an independent asymmetry in power. It leaves the globally least-advantaged
trapped in place, where undesirable opportunities can be clustered, and

costs and risks can be segregated away from high-income countries and
their citizens.
In response, I argue for an extension of one of the tools used to
prevent group-based social control and the segregation of unequal opportunities domestically: the right to move across space. This right can
serve three roles. First, it increases the autonomy of those suffering the
greatest autonomy deficit. Second, it allows people to improve their life
prospects. Third, and most importantly, it prevents the spatial clustering
of negative externalities and undesirable opportunities.
Equality of Opportunity and Migration
The liberal conception of EO is most prominently developed by John
Rawls. On Rawls’s view, socioeconomic inequalities are only justifiable
if they are: a) attached to positions available to all under conditions of
fair equality of opportunity (FEO), and b) to the greatest advantage of
the least-advantaged group.4
 FEO requires not just non-discrimination,
but also that those who are equally talented and motivated should have
the same likelihood of success.5
 This involves restricting inequality and
equalizing educational resources.
However, this extends well beyond the schoolhouse, applying to all
aspects of society that reliably affect development.6
 Environmental toxins, prenatal nutrition, access to childcare, and healthcare are also among
the social determinants of opportunity. Left unregulated, they distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of group membership—e.g., race,
gender, and class. They ensure that the least desirable opportunities are
clustered around the least-advantaged.
Joseph Carens helped popularize the global extension of EO, arguing
that citizenship is the last “feudal privilege” accepted within liberalism.
Liberal philosophers reject hierarchies based on race, sex, religion, and
class. Most accept the Rawlsian demand that all citizens have equal access
to desirable opportunities. Yet this value often has rigid borders. We have
“a commitment to equality of opportunity for people within democratic
states . . . , but no pretense, or even aspiration. . .across states.”7
 Arbitrary
facts about one’s birth are coercively enforced, restricting people’s mobility and trapping them in the opportunity sets into which they were born.
This is, on Carens’s view, clearly unjust. After all, the ideal of EO “is
intimately linked to the view that all human beings are of equal moral
worth.”8
 However, despite this moral equality, “contemporary social arrangements not only grant great advantages on the basis of birth but also
entrench these advantages by legally restricting mobility.”9

Carens’s solution is to guarantee that everybody has the right to immigrate in pursuit of better opportunities. This prevents people from
being trapped in undesirable opportunity sets, ending what Carens identifies as a citizenship-based global caste system. While this is not sufficient to ensure that Rawls’s FEO is met globally, freedom of movement is
necessary for equalizing opportunities in a world where citizenship determines life prospects. It gives people the right, if not ability, to pursue
desirable opportunities.
There have been several prominent criticisms of Carens’s argument.
First, critics have pushed back against the luck egalitarianism implicit in
Carens’s argument.10 While borders might be arbitrary and do cement
(un)lucky facts about one’s birth, this “is an embarrassment only for
those who thought of liberalism as requiring the elimination of random
chance.”11 Instead, liberalism is concerned with “how a political society
might justify its coercive laws and practices specifically to those within
its jurisdiction.”12 The goal is not to eliminate inequalities wherever they
are found and however they arose, but to ensure “that people are not subordinated or marginalized within relationships or institutional contexts
of which they are a part.”13
Second, critics argue that coercion is necessary for implementing
EO. Equalizing access to education, for example, requires a “government
or some set of institutions” with the power to enforce this requirement,
allocate funds, and ensure uniform academic standards.14 Promoting EO
is institutionally demanding, requiring considerable information, coercive control, and distributive capacities. It is a political value that can
only exist within the context of a coercive state with both the duty and
the power to promote equality between citizens.15 The lack of relevant
institutions globally suggests that global EO is an inert moral value with
little practical political applicability.
Third, critics argue that EO is a distinctly cultural value and hence
incompatible with a global extension.16 The desirability of opportunities
is not given by nature but is largely a product of local values and the
history of the community. Therefore, while we might be able to rank opportunities domestically, and can take steps to ensure that citizens are
equally able to develop their talents and pursue desirable careers, we lack
the cultural homogeneity to do this globally.
These criticisms raise important questions about a global extension
of EO. We need to know exactly what the extension requires—is it the
full version of EO, or merely open borders as a way of promoting EO?
My goal will be to explain why freedom of movement is a part of EO and

70  Essays in Philosophy Volume 22, Issue 1–2
why it is required globally. This involves justifying both the extension of
EO and why the focus is on freedom of movement in particular.
The literature on EO has largely focused on group-based labor market segregation within space. On this view, EO is violated when groups of
people within a particular area are restricted to a cluster of undesirable
opportunities—due to unequal educational opportunities or discrimination. My project is to develop a second focus: space-based labor market
segregation. Here there are groups that are spatially segregated, who have
limited access to move across space, and whose spatial location shapes
their opportunities.17
By analyzing feudal caste systems and segregation I show how spatial
segregation and restrictions on mobility have been intimately bound up
with questions of EO. A common way of perpetuating unequal opportunities, and maintaining social control, has been through restricting mobility. Finally, I discuss how the transnational economy has generated a
new set of relationships within which freedom of movement has become
an important element of global EO.18
Feudalism, Segregation, and Equal Opportunity
Joseph Carens drew attention to some of the parallels between feudalism
and our current migration regime in order to highlight the injustice of
our current practice. Both practices involve inherited privileges as well
as coercive restrictions on mobility that cement unequal opportunity.19
In this section I expand on this analysis, illustrating how spatial segregation does not just prevent people from leaving the bad opportunities that
they were unlucky enough to inherit, but that it also helps create these
opportunities, permitting exploitation and control of a prone population.
While feudal societies are more complicated than popular presentations suggest, the basic relationship between feudal lords and serfs involved three elements. First, the authority wielded by the lord over the
serf. Second, the right of the serf to work a plot of land to secure their
means of subsistence. And third, the requirement that the serf work for
the lord several days per week, unremunerated save for the protection
and land offered by the lord.
Within feudal systems, a serf “receives the use of a small plot of land
instead of wages and. . .produces goods for the lord on pain of physical coercion.”20 If they sought to exit the relationship, fleeing to nearby
towns, they were treated as thieves. This was “reflected in the laws which
tie serfs to the land and which prevent the flight of serfs to the city. . .the

fleeing serf, like the fleeing slave, has stolen property from the lord.”21
They were thus chained to their social position, the lord, and the land.
Restrictions on movement across social positions and space were
vital to the feudal system. Without hereditary privileges, the risks of serfdom would fall equally on all. Without binding serfs to the land and
lord, many would simply leave feudal relationships, or offer themselves
to kindlier lords. These restrictions allowed lords to retain their authority
and complete bargaining advantage.
While we should be cautious of making analogies between time periods and between distinct societies, many of the problematic features
of feudalism—assignation to fixed, hierarchical and exploitative social
positions and spatial segregation—characterize many contemporary social and economic arrangements. Spatial segregation continues to divide
people, tie them to land, and shape their life prospects. The history of
the U.S., for example, involves a cruel coalescence of de jure and de facto
segregation. Coates detailed how redlining intentionally worked towards
the segregation of neighborhoods, forcing black home buyers into a contract system that had deleterious effects on black wealth. Specifically, the
U.S. government “insured private mortgages” but “adopted a system of
maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability.”22
Mixed-race and black neighborhoods were labeled unstable, redlined,
and became ineligible for FHA-backed loans.
Richard Rothstein notes that de jure segregation in the U.S. did not
end with redlining. Instead, “real estate commissions licensed members
of local and national real estate boards whose published codes of ethics
mandated discrimination.”23 Lending agents that were underwritten—
and monitored—by the state offered discriminatory loans.24 Moreover,
“[i]t wasn’t only the large-scale federal programs of public housing and
mortgage finance that created de jure segregation. Hundreds, if not thousands, of smaller acts of government contributed,” including “denial of
access to public utilities,” “routing interstate highways to create racial
boundaries,” and unequal public spending in nonwhite neighborhoods.25
Segregation has several implications for socioeconomic justice. First,
segregated communities are more susceptible to group-based social control—the “war on drugs” in the U.S. being a clear example. Targeted
control is facilitated by segregation, permitting increased enforcement
in Black and other minoritized communities.26 If affluent white citizens
suffered the consequences of the war on drugs, the political blowback
would render such policies untenable. This system requires that negative

72  Essays in Philosophy Volume 22, Issue 1–2
effects be localized in racial communities and spatial segregation facilitates this segregation of effects.
Second, segregation permits the worst externalities of production
to be clustered in marginalized communities. Manufacturing zones are
largely situated in poor, often nonwhite neighborhoods because doing
so is less costly—both economically and politically.27 And factory farms
are disproportionately located in poor communities of color.28 This has
devastating effects on home values, quality of living, and health for those
living in the shadows of their effluence.
Third, communities segregated by race and socioeconomic class are
more often both job and consumer-goods deserts.29 With white flight,
disinvestment, and increased rates of poverty, segregated communities
of marginalized people become undesirable to, and operate at a deficit
of, consumer-driven businesses.30 The loss of wealth due to white flight
means that middle class consumers make up a smaller percentage of the
community. With disinvestment, these communities also lack the economic policies that attract businesses—community development, infrastructure, and favorable tax breaks for corporations. The result is a
dearth of jobs and material goods as businesses increasingly locate closer
to the suburbs and other middle-class, white communities.31
Finally, a large population of poor and more often unemployed citizens is ripe for exploitation. Those with few employment options and
desperate for income are more likely to accept lower salaries and worse
workplace conditions. Spatial segregation, therefore, can decrease bargaining power and leave people prone in their relationships with employers.
Feudal systems and segregated societies illustrate several reasons
why space and mobility matter. First, restrictions on mobility leave
people trapped in place, prone, and with little (or no) bargaining power.
This can affect their status with both the state and employers, making
social control, violence, marginalization, and hyper-exploitation more
likely. Second, a segregated and marginalized community is likely to
experience the worst externalities of production, with segregation also
exacerbating these externalities. If the costs of cheap transnational production—environmental degradation, weakly integrated TNCs with
plentiful exit options, unlivable wages, and poor workplaces conditions,
for example—are isolated over there and with them, there is little incentive to work on regulating and restricting them. And third, segregated
and immobile communities are liable to suffer from the relative mobility

Michael Ball-Blakely | Migration, Mobility, and Spatial Segregation: Freedom of Movement  73
of capital, as they are at greater risk of becoming job and consumer-good
deserts.32
Building on Rawls’s conception, and incorporating the lessons from
feudalism and segregation, I identify four tools for promoting EO. The
first is formal freedom of movement. The second is adequate resources
to take advantage of mobility rights. The third is a principle of non-discrimination by admissions and hiring committees. And the fourth is a
requirement that all persons have an equal chance to develop their talents.
These elements contribute, in different ways, to preventing the
space- or group-based clustering of negative externalities and powerlessness in an economic practice. The first two prevent the spatial segregation of costs and risks by ensuring that people can leave undesirable
opportunity sets. The last two prevent the group-based segregation of
opportunities within space by ensuring that people are not prevented—
by the socioeconomic position of their birth—from accessing desirable
opportunities.
The requirements of EO depend upon the nature of the practice and
the needs of the parties within it. Domestically, the inescapable and determinative nature of the economic system, combined with states’ duties
to citizens, suggests that all four requirements are necessary. Freedom
of movement and adequate resources help prevent de jure and de facto
segregation. Non-discrimination and substantively equal educational
opportunities ensure that people do not inherit their social position.
At present, citizens of low-income countries suffer a considerable
power disadvantage in their relationships with TNCs and high-income
countries. Restrictions on their mobility not only leave them trapped in
undesirable opportunity sets, but they also perpetuate and exacerbate
these undesirable opportunities. Closure segregates the costs in lowincome countries, allowing TNCs and high-income countries to avoid
the negative externalities incurred by their actions, and prevents the migration of those who experience the worst effects of the transnational
practice.
Freedom of movement as EO is required as a tool for eliminating the
spatial segregation of negative externalities and opportunities in the current global practice. This is not to say, however, that increased mobility is
the only possible solution. Placing restrictions on the behavior of TNCs
and high-income countries while enacting policies aimed at eliminating
global inequalities would also mitigate the spatial segregation of undesirable opportunities and externalities. However, this option remains a
distant possibility, foreclosed for now by the lack of institutions and poGenerated for EBSCO inc. 2021/3/17 © 2021 Philosophy Documentation Center

litical will. Moreover, we have seen in the U.S. that even with all of the
protections of a liberal democracy, spatial segregation leaves the rights of
some groups insecure and unstable. Accordingly, maintaining a system
of border control while working to extend other protections is a precarious and likely only partial solution even if enacted.
Finally, while fully achieving global EO involves other elements—
specifically, non-discrimination in admissions policies and adequate resources to migrate—I am only arguing for the necessity of freedom of
movement. One reason for this is the deep controversy surrounding the
full global extension of EO. I aim to present an argument for freedom
of movement as a part of EO that is more easily embraced by political
liberals for whom the full range of socioeconomic rights are dependent
upon coercion or robust political relationships. Moreover, freedom of
movement might, if enacted, have dramatic effects on the global practice.
If increased mobility can change the incentive structure of high-income
countries and TNCs, as well as motivate a reduction of negative externalities and undermine relationships of domination, then progress towards
global equality should result.
Mobility, Space, and the Transnational Economy
Whether it warrants the full extension of EO, the effects of the global
practice on the least-advantaged suffice to require freedom of movement
as a tool for EO.33 Border controls are not univocally applied and have
radically different impacts depending on who—or what—is seeking to
cross them. Capital enjoys porous borders designed to facilitate its mobility. The affluent and “skilled” have a much easier time immigrating
to the most desirable countries. However, the global poor find nearly
impenetrable borders created to keep them from entering high-income
countries.
This tiered system of borders is a feature of what William Robinson
calls a transnational economy. The stage of globalization that was marked
by a world economy largely involved national production and international trade. Global organizations could exert pressure on countries to
liberalize and powerful countries could resort to violence as well as tariffs and subsidies. However, during the world economy, production still
occurred primarily within national boundaries. And if corporations had
needs for foreign labor, they had to have it brought to them.
Transnational capitalism has seen these borders weakened for TNCs
but hardened to the movement of most people. In this way, TNCs are
largely “liberated from the nation-state” and with increased mobility capiGenerated for EBSCO inc. 2021/3/17 © 2021 Philosophy Documentation Center

tal has “assumed tremendous new power relative to labor.”34 Production is
severed from the home countries of TNCs and fragmented into subsidiaries that each perform small, relatively isolated stages of production.
This has several implications. First, it has given capital greater power
over countries. Able to move freely, TNCs can demand minimal labor
and environmental standards, decreased tax burdens, and low wages.
This mobility has made it:
difficult to ‘trap’ capital in any one place long enough to regulate its
practices or tax its profits, much less bargain collectively with it on an
equal footing. . .In the process of losing dominion over place, ordinary
workers, consumers, and citizens seem to lose the leverage they need to
exert influence on the key decisions that affect their lives.35
This has shifted a delicate balance of power where workers were already
facing a power deficit. Corporations have become detethered from the
state, where control over their behavior was at least feasible, and left free
to pursue the most profitable jurisdictions to the detriment of national
sovereignty and worker protections.36
Whether this creates a “race to the bottom,” with countries downwardly competing for TNCs, “tax competition undermines the fiscal
self-determination of states, that is, their ability to effectively set the size
of the budget and the extent of redistribution.”37 The result is not just
distributive but concerns the balance of power itself. The global search
for the most profitable site for production means that “de facto control
over actual government revenues is considerably weakened.”38 Economic
policies become shaped by TNCs that can just as easily relocate or refuse
to come in the first place.
Control over low-income countries and their citizens is not only
wielded by TNCs.39 High-income countries also shape international
organizations to suit their interests. Low-income countries have “little
choice but to join these organizations, yet, as members, have limited influence over them.”40 These organizations then place stringent demands
on economic policies, enforcing a uniform liberalization on low-income
countries.
Moreover, would-be migrants do not first confront high-income
countries when they petition for entry, but “are in a relationship of dependence with the countries which exclude them” and “either cannot
leave the relationship, or their exist costs are too high for them to do so
realistically.”41 High-income countries and international organizations
exercise power over low-income countries, affecting the policy decisions

76  Essays in Philosophy Volume 22, Issue 1–2
of the latter to suit the interests of the former. Control over migration
maintains this relationship and the powerlessness of the least-advantaged within it.
This analysis fits comfortably within the literature on world systems
theory.42 According to this view, “migration is a natural outgrowth of
disruptions and dislocations that inevitably occur in the process of capitalist development” (Massey, et al. 1993 p. 445). Patterns of migration are
not simply the result of would-be migrants pursuing higher wages, better workplace conditions, and increased political stability. Instead, “[m]
igration is caused by the disruption of economies in the periphery that
are transformed for the benefit of the developed world (the core).”43 The
behavior of TNCs and high-income countries destabilizes and disrupts
economies of low-income countries, while at the same time creating the
cultural and economic linkages that motivate movement—or, at least,
the desire to immigrate—into these same high-income countries.44
The costs of this system for the least-advantaged would ordinarily
precipitate movement from low- to high-income countries. However,
border control “shields prosperous and peaceful states from the great
majority of those who—in a world without borders and exclusive citizenries—would seek to flee war, civil strife, famine, joblessness, or environmental degradation.”45 If high-income countries experienced the
spillover effects of production—or their foreign policy—they might
work to prevent them from occurring. Borders, however, trap these costs
in place, preventing them from affecting the globally advantaged. This
both perpetuates and exacerbates these costs.
Second, the transnational economy has increased the relative power
of capital. With TNCs able to leave in pursuit of cheaper production,
workers have lost a powerful bargaining chip, diminishing already meager labor protections. Were corporations trapped in place, they could not
leverage the existence of the rest of the global labor force against employees. And without such impenetrable borders, TNCs would no longer find
a prone, trapped workforce. People would instead be able to immigrate
to countries where workplace standards and wages were more palatable.
The relationship, therefore, depends on the different ways that borders
operate for capital and labor.
Third, the ability to fragment production between nations eliminates
the need to develop infrastructure and education where production occurs. The infrastructure that accompanies TNCs is often weakly integrated, aimed more at moving goods out of the country than meeting
domestic needs. This can be seen in the highways constructed in Mexico

Michael Ball-Blakely | Migration, Mobility, and Spatial Segregation: Freedom of Movement  77
in the 1940s, “which followed the blueprint of U.S.-built railroads that
were laid out in a north-south pattern. Building the roads in this fashion
facilitated the export of goods. . .and only secondarily were these roads
connected with Mexico’s economic heartland.”46 This is part of a trend
where TNCs fail to embed themselves within domestic supply chains in
the ways that make for a vibrant economy. For example, maquila plants
were “little more than export platforms disconnected from the rest of
Mexico’s economy” and had “little ‘spin-off ’ effects; they are islands of
U.S. production in Mexico’s soil.”47 This not only increases the bargaining power of TNCs, but it means that low-income countries often do not
enjoy most of the benefits of globalization.
The lucrative flexibility of capital and the privileges of affluent citizens in high-income countries depend upon a system of divided citizenships. This provides capital with a reserve army of labor, to be brought
here, pursued there, or ignored depending on need. It ensures that those
who suffer negative externalities are prone non-nationals. And it means
that aggressive behavior by high-income countries—e.g., regime change
or war for natural resources—does not necessarily lead to mass migration into these high-income countries. This reduces the costs for the affluent by keeping costs located in segregated communities of the globally
marginalized.
Equal Opportunity Revisited
Without freedom of movement, costs and benefits become segregated
and unequal opportunities become generationally entrenched. Within
feudalism, restrictions on mobility kept serfs chained to the land and
lord. Segregated communities of marginalized groups help isolate negative political and economic externalities, leaving some suffering the
most severe costs of political and economic policies. Similarly, within
the transnational economy, restrictions on mobility help create prone
populations where environmental costs, low-wage work, and weakly integrated production can all be reliably located.
This system also generates perverse incentivizes in TNCs and highincome countries. Without having to suffer the costs of production or
foreign policy decisions—e.g., the mass migration of those negatively
impacted—there will be little incentive to check pernicious behavior. A
vital role of freedom of movement, therefore, is equalizing bargaining
power and changing incentive structures within an economic practice.48
While there are reasons for endorsing the other elements of EO—
group-based discrimination in migration policies is largely seen as imGenerated for EBSCO inc. 2021/3/17 © 2021 Philosophy Documentation Center

permissible and unequal resources leave many of the least-advantaged
unable to make use of formal mobility rights—I have focused solely on
freedom of movement. It can be a vital tool for disincentivizing the clustering of negative externalities and undesirable opportunities in lowincome countries and giving the least-advantaged the ability to pursue
better life prospects.
This is not an argument for eliminating either territorial boundaries
or the privileges of citizenship. Nor is it an argument against any restrictions on mobility. Public order exemptions would still be available to
high-income countries. Moreover, it is decidedly not an argument for
open borders from high- to low-income countries.49 Instead, it is only an
argument that high-income countries have a duty of justice to eliminate
restrictions on mobility from low-income countries.
This account serves three roles. First, it further explains the relationship between freedom of movement and EO. Second, it illustrates why
freedom of movement as a tool for EO is warranted. And third, it is more
compatible with political liberalism and can better avoid the criticisms
listed above. Since the first and second have already been discussed, I will
now briefly explain how it avoids these standard objections.
According to critics, Carens’s argument for a global extension of EO
ignores the intrinsically political and relational nature of EO. Its normative significance, they argue, depends upon people being members of a
shared society within which unequal opportunity creates hierarchies between equal citizens, or where the state must justify its use of coercion to
citizens. On my account, however, the goal of freedom of movement as
EO is not to promote global economic equality, nor is the goal to eliminate the effects of luck. Instead, the goal is to eliminate the space-based
oppression and control of the globally least-advantaged. It is not just
that borders prevent people from pursuing desirable opportunities; they
also incentivize the creation and clustering of undesirable opportunities
and negative externalities. If restrictions on mobility predictably lead to
power being harmfully wielded against the least-advantaged, then it is
unjust whether it happens within or across state borders.
Critics also argue that coercion is vital for achieving EO. To ensure
equal access to desirable opportunities we have to have institutions with
the power to secure these goals. There are, at present, no institutions with
the ability to promote equal education or to ensure that opportunities
are spread diffusely around the world. And unilateral action in a transnational economy is unlikely to secure the kind of background justice
needed for a full global extension of EO—even if we had the political

will to pursue it. However, despite serious questions about political will,
and despite there being considerable problems for states that unilaterally
open their borders in response to injustice, we do not require coercive
institutions to implement freedom of movement. There is not an institutional barrier to open borders, only problems of coordination and political will.
Finally, critics have argued that a global extension of EO ignores the
intrinsically cultural nature of desirable opportunities. We cannot ensure
that all have equal access to equally desirable opportunities without having some universal metric for ranking opportunities. This might raise
some problems for a full global extension of EO—though I am skeptical
about whether we can achieve a coherent ranking nationally, and the
spirit of EO is providing people with the tools to make their own decisions about how to develop and apply their talents. It is not, however, a
problem for freedom of movement as a tool for equalizing opportunities. This limited conclusion does not require that we identify and rank
the most valuable opportunities. It only requires that borders be opened
from low- to high-income countries.
Conclusion
In this paper I have argued for a reinterpretation of EO. An examination
of feudalism and segregation reveals how restrictions on mobility and
on opportunities are interwoven. By being held in place—through legal
restrictions, group-based discrimination, or poverty—people become
trapped and powerless, susceptible to social control and economic oppression. Freedom of movement plays a vital role not only in preventing
this, but in disincentivizing this treatment in the first place. By losing a
prone population, states and TNCs must modify their behavior in light
of the effects of their policies. If hyper-exploitation and environmental
degradation lead people to leave in pursuit of better workplace and environmental protections, then these policies are no longer rational. The
movement of individuals allows the least-advantaged to modify the incentive structure of powerful actors.
This analysis of EO helps explain why the ideal applies globally. By
dividing EO into its basic elements, unpacking them and evaluating
their applicability individually, it avoids unduly extending domestic conceptions of justice. It avoids making controversial claims about global
egalitarian duties or the significance of luck. And it deploys a normative
premise—that leveraging people’s powerlessness to force them to accept
