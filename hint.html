<p>ECONOMIC TRANSITION AS CONTINUITY
(ON THE TRANSITION FROM FEUDALISM
TO CAPITALISM IN SLOVENIA)
 The aim of this paper is to establish the common features of the transition process from feudalism to the capitalist economic system in Slovenia. In the
processes of the transition to the capitalist economy, Slovenia was on the European periphery. The export demand was the driving force of structural changes
in the regional economy, as the weak internal demand was not in the position
to foster economic development. Slovenian economy and society entered these
processes with a delay of decades as well as with some discontinuity in the form
of re-agrarization and de-industrialization, as it is outlined in the concept of
proto-industrialization. During the periods of re-agrarization the model of distribution of the existing resources was predominant. It manifested itself in the
form of the fragmentation of agricultural ownership structure, which was the
most significant factor of the relative economic backwardness of the Slovenian
territory. The Slovenian economic subjects were small, under-capitalized, and
with outdated technology, and therefore uncompetitive on the interregional markets. So the prime instigators of the economic changes were foreign entrepreneurs with their know-how, capital, technology, and international markets. In
the period before World War II the role of foreign investments was crucial for
the process of the transformation into the capitalist economy. The most significant historical feature of the Slovenian economic development is the fact that the
existing »islands of modernization«, which were more or less in line with European trends, remained »islands« until their power to stimulate structural changes
and new institutional forms in economy vanished completely in the predominantly agrarian economic and social environment.
Key words: economic transtition, economic development, social transformation, Slovenia

In the modern discourse the concept of economic transition relates to the
economic and social transformation of the former communist countries in the
1990s. Transition has been defined as a concept, denoting the economy undergoing a process of transformation from the centrally-planned structure to the
market economy.1
 In its essence transition denotes an all-encompassing transformation of the economic system. It presupposes a complete takeover of the
formal and informal market institutions and the abolishment of the communist
economic system. In view of the substantive level of changes the term »transformation« would be more suitable, which is also proposed and used by some
authors in the social sciences.2
 If we disregard the exceedingly modern connotation of the concept of transition and apply it in the sense of the transformation
from one economic system to another, different economic system, then other
possibilities open up for us as well. Namely, the concept of economic transition
in the sense of the transition to another economic system may also be used in
order to denote the processes that dissolved the feudal economic structure and
led to the transition to the capitalist economic system. These were two transitions during which the social and economic institutions had to be transformed.3
In the case of the transition in the 1990s this involved a centralised and super1 For the methodological definition of the concept of transition and its first interpretative
use in the Slovenian historiography see Lorenčič, Aleksander (2012), Prelom s starim in

regardless of the level of institutionalisation, in the field of mental structures, schemes,
rules, norms and traditions, defining, as social standards, the behaviour in the society
and economy in an authoritarian manner. A clear identification of these institutions
and their forms in view of the temporal dynamics enables us to gain insight into the
process characteristics of the development of individual societies, while the comparative
aspect allows for the consideration of the relevance of their general validity. For more

Economic transition as continuity (on the transition from feudalism...) 63
vised process of the formation of new institutions, which was supposed to take
approximately two decades. On the other hand the transition from feudalism to
capitalism was decentralised, slow and gradual. Unlike the modern understanding of economic transition, where the processes can be measured in mere decades, the latter involved processes which took centuries.
The purpose of this discussion is to find the common elements of the
transition from feudalism to capitalism in the last few centuries. For this
purpose, in view of the state of historiographical research, we chose to focus on
three periods: the time of the 16th and 18th century and the so-called “century
of capitalism”, arbitrarily defined as taking place from the middle of the 19th to
the middle of the 20th century. The concept of economic lag is emphasised as
the starting point of the discussion. As this is an extremely complex research
issue, the discussion will limit itself to the level of the most general points,
that is, the comparison of the basic denominators of the economic dynamics,
fulfilling the criterion of the long-term nature, which can be generalised as a
historical constant. Our goal is to confront the realisations of the individual
research analyses from the viewpoint of the long-term perspective and unify
them in terms of the problem/interpretative common denominators. With
such a concept this discussion will unavoidably be exposed for the possible
(justified!) criticism due to the generalisation and simplification of the historical
processes at the Slovenian level, let alone the narrower regional or even local
levels. However, there is a reason for such a concept of the discussion. As it is, we
aim to encourage further debate, reconsiderations, and ultimately perhaps also
the emergence of new concepts of the research thematisation of the long-term
tendencies and circumstances of the economic development in the Slovenian
territory in the modern age.
Like other historiographies, Slovenian economic historiography is based on
the supposition of a constant, almost linear and gradual progress.4
 That means
that it is based on the principle of continuity. At the same time the principle
of dissimilarity in the process dynamics is integrated into this model. That
means that the supposition of constant progress is also accompanied with the
qualitative definition: that in case of the Slovenian economic development we
are dealing with lag. The term of lag itself, or, more precisely, the concept of
the relative economic backwardness5
, denotes the diverging dynamics of the

for the time of the 19th century in order to explain the various starting points before the
entry of certain regions/states into the industrialisation process. In light of the supposition
that the regional differences in the levels of economic development in Europe are older
and thus reveal themselves as something permanent, the use of Gerschenkron's concept
is completely appropriate. For more detailed information see Gerschenkron, Alexander

economic development, which become apparent from a comparative analysis
with the immediate or more remote surroundings. In this way we are opening the
issue of the relative regional differences in the European space in the historical
perspective, as it is certain that the concept of the economic lag addresses the
relationship between the levels of the economic development in Slovenia and
Western Europe. The dynamics and forms of the Western European economic
development represent a model to which the economic development elsewhere is
compared. By introducing the concept of lag we also introduce a few teleological
elements into the interpretation of economic history, as in this way we supposedly
know the goal towards which history is headed. Societies which are identical or
similar to the Western European model with regard to the economic structure,
developmental dynamics and institutional economic forms are seen as modern,
while all others are considered as backwards. Such a division becomes even
deeper in the most recent industrial age and acquires additional manifestations
in comparison with the preceding periods.
The thesis about the lag involved in the Slovenian economic development is
generally accepted. Moreover, it has often been completely clearly substantiated
in the theoretical and empirical sense – also in different periods, but most notably
for the 16th century, 18th century, and for the period of the 19th or 20th-century
industrialisation or the century of capitalism. As far as the 16th century is
concerned, we cannot overlook the in-depth analyses carried out by Ferdo
Gestrin6
, who presented this time as a period of confrontation and intertwining
of the old and vanishing forms of medieval institutions and the emerging modern
times, with the first outlines of the new views and forms of the economic and
social life. Gestrin completely unequivocally defines the end of this period as
an open manifestation of the economic lag process. In these definitions Gestrin
is also joined by Jože Šorn, who placed his book on the beginnings of industry
in the time of the 18th century and the pre-March period. The message of Šorn's
monograph is clear, and already Jasna Fischer and Peter Vodopivec brought

to mention a series of three articles, published by Ferdo Gestrin in 1968, in which he
provided a synthetic overview of the basic economic processes in the Slovenian territory
from the 16th and until the end of the 19th century, later also published in various other
forms. See Gestrin, Ferdo (1969): Oris gospodarstva na Slovenskem v obodobju zgodnjega

the attention to it in their foreword written on the occasion of the posthumous
publication of Šorn's book in 1984. The presented empirical materials attest to
the slowness of the economic structural changes (as the relationship between
the agrarian and non-agrarian part of the economy) in the Slovenian territory,
leading to the increasing gap between the development dynamics of Slovenia
and other provinces of the Habsburg Monarchy, especially in comparison with
the Czech lands. Furthermore, Šorn's thesis is that in the first half of the 19th
century the developmental differences even deepened.7
 The discourse of lag also
remains an important interpretative aspect in the evaluation of the economic
development of the Slovenian territory in the 19th and 20th century. Thus we
can underline the complex study carried out by Mojca Novak, who successfully
integrated the exploration of Slovenian industrialisation into a wider theoretical
comparative context from the viewpoint of the sociological definition of the
problem.8
 The regional economic differences in the Habsburg Monarchy in
the second half of the 19th century at the level of individual provinces were
presented convincingly by Andrej Pančur. His study also confirms the thesis of
the below-average development of the Slovenian provinces, lagging behind with
regard to the implementation of the industrialisation processes.9
 Žarko Lazarević
has underlined the disproportionate dynamics of the economic development
by referring to gross domestic products. In a special study he focused on the
long-term economic development of Slovenia from the middle of the 19th to the
end of the 20th century in the European perspective, i.e., through the relations
between the gross domestic product levels of Slovenia and other European
countries. On the basis of the results it can be summed up that Slovenia, in the
historical perspective of the last two centuries, lags behind the countries of the
North-Western Europe, that is, behind the countries where the unstoppable
progress of the industrial revolution first started. However, Slovenia has kept
its development at approximately the same level as the Southern European or
Mediterranean countries. However, if we look towards the East, it becomes
apparent that especially in the 20th century Slovenia has increased its economic

advantage in comparison with the other former communist countries of the
Eastern Europe and the Balkans.10
Thus the aforementioned studies (and not only these) unequivocally
register the dichotomy between the economic-developmental dynamics
between Slovenia and its immediate north-western surroundings. It is also
obvious that long-term developmental characteristics are involved. Thus the
words of the American economist John Galbraith – that in order to understand
the economic position of individual countries it is very important to know
where they were in the distant past – are also very true in case of the Slovenian
economic development.11 The awareness of the historical bases for the various
economic stages in the European space has been present for a long time. This
realisation was especially relevant for the thematisation of the process of
industrialisation and its territorial expansion. Researchers promptly established
that at the outset, on the same timeline, individual countries were in different
positions, stemming from the centuries of differences in their developmental
paths in the context of the feudal social and economic system.12 The researchers
especially emphasise the various levels of productivity in agriculture due to the
different technologies of production, consequently resulting in just as diverse
potentials for economic growth.13 An important emphasis has also been
placed on other dissimilarities, for example the question of ownership rights
(that is, the capacity to transform the pre-capitalist forms of ownership rights

Economic transition as continuity (on the transition from feudalism...) 67
into capitalist rights), personal freedoms, or role and structure of the cities, to
mention but a few categories.14
Regardless of the fact that when emphasising the three comparative overviews
from the Slovenian economic history we are dealing with three different historical
contexts, the continuity of the economic lag is the very phenomenon that brings
together the interpretations of the Slovenian economic history from the 16th and
until the end of the 20th century. The interpretative approaches of the economic
history in the second half of the previous millennium are also brought together
by the fact that with the exception of the second half of the 20th century Slovenia
was a traditional society, in which agriculture was an irreplaceable economic
sector. Precisely the changing percentage of the peasant population is one of the
key indicators of the developmental economic dynamics, average productivity
and economic structure.
The classic economic theory states that four demands have to be met in
order to ensure economic development: a society must have suitable human and
natural resources as well as the accumulation of capital and technology at its
disposal. These four pillars of development function in a reciprocal manner. A
registered lag in combination with slow economic restructuring based on the
model of economically superiorly developed environments places a certain (also
Slovenian) environment in the framework of the economically and theoretically
defined model of poverty in the long-term.15 If we enter this circle in the field
of the slow accumulation of capital, then we can detect the lack of considerable
investments in technology, resulting in low labour productivity. On the basis
of the low average labour productivity or low efficiency of the economy as
a whole, high population income cannot be ensured. The low average level of
the population income is barely enough for survival, therefore hindering the
demand, considerable savings and investments, which, in turn, leads to slow
accumulation of capital. Thus the circle is complete. From all of the above the
reciprocity of the individual developmental categories is completely obvious. On
this basis we can conclude that technology or the achieved technological level
determines the production structure of a certain society/economy, structure of

the regional/international commercial exchange, and thus also the position in
the regional/international division of labour.16
Apart from the lag, as defined by the aforementioned authors, the
time periods under consideration also share their process characteristics.
In accordance with the modern distinctions between the models
of economic development we can introduce into our discussion the
moments of the proto-industrial and industrial society or the processes of
proto-industrialisation and industrialisation, coinciding with the transition
from the feudal economic system to the capitalist system. If there are
no dichotomies as far as the definition of industrialisation or industrial
society is concerned, this is not so in case of the concept and interpretative
scheme of proto-industrialisation. The concept of proto-industrialisation,
which has taken firm root in the economic-historical science, was outlined
by Franklin Mendels on the basis of his own research.17 To sum it up very
briefly, Mendels saw proto-industrialisation as a stage in the development of
the modern economy based on industry, taking place in the context of the
completely dissolved or dissolving feudal connections. With the concept of
proto-industrialisation Mendels denoted the processes when in the rural
areas the peasant craft production (as a supplementary or exclusive activity)
strengthened either individually or in the context of the putting-out system.
This was a widespread phenomenon in the various regions of Europe. Through
trade relations this kind of production integrated the peasants into the market,
market relations and division of labour at the regional, national, and also
international level apart from the mere agricultural production and breeding.
The process of proto-industrialisation involved the commercialisation of the
agricultural craft knowledge and technology, which was supposedly present in
the rural areas due to the dominant principle of the self-supply of these areas
or the principle of the previous self-sufficiency of agricultural economies. The
labour force price, significantly lower due to the agriculture as the primary
activity, supposedly represented a competitive advantage in comparison
with the craft-guild production. The processes of proto-industrialisation
also triggered the processes of economic growth, accumulation of capital,
business skills, and agricultural progress. Furthermore, Mendels also
ascribed the process of proto-industrialisation with having far-reaching social
implications from the reciprocal connections between the intensity of the
proto-industrialisation processes and the changes of the population number,
family structure, fragmentation of land, and increase in dependent labour (not
to say proletarisation) in the rural areas. Proto-industry allegedly also started

solving the Malthusian trap, which was ultimately broken by industrialisation.
With economic growth and the increasing income of the peasant population
the processes of proto-industrialisation contributed to the long-term
strengthening of demand or consumption, which became the driving force of
industrialisation in the modern sense of the word.
Just like any other model, the Mendels's concept of proto-industrialisation
has faced many objections and corrections due to its aspirations for general
validity.18 Doubts have stemmed from new research, questioning or further
developing many suppositions of Mendels’s, especially in the social field. At the
level of the foundations the critics of the proto-industrialisation concept were
compatible with Alexander Geschenkron, who emphasised the divergence of
the paths taken by the individual regions/provinces towards industrialisation
and the lack of a certain general model of industrialisation in Europe.19 The
criticism of the proto-industrialisation model stemmed from the extensive
empirical materials from various parts of Europe. These detailed studies showed
that just like we cannot speak about a uniform pattern during the process of
industrialisation, proto-industrialisation is hardly any different. Significant
differences in the manifestations of proto-industrialisation were registered. The
theorem of proto-industrialisation turned out to be a flexible process, resulting
from the adaptation to the local social and economic contexts.20 The principle
of discontinuity was built into the concept of proto-industrialisation as well.
The term »de-industrialisation« was introduced to denote the process when
the proto-industrialisation phenomena stopped (due to various economic,
political or social reasons) and the supplemental production was abandoned
in certain areas. Thus these areas became more dependent or were once again
completely dependent on agricultural production. The automatic transition
of the proto-industrial production to the modern industrial organisation
of acquiring goods was therefore questioned. The arguments were clear.
The empirical materials did not provide enough arguments to give the

of the generalised models of interpreting the historical economic processes. 19 Gerschenkron, referenced work. See also the synthetic summary of the topical debates
about the industrial revolution in Beaudoin, Steven M. (2000): Current Debates in the
Study of the Industrial Revolution. In: OAH Magazine of History, 15, No. 1, pp. 7–13. 20 Mendels's concept of proto-industrialisation encouraged a lively discussion among
economic historians. For more detailed viewpoints see, for example, Colleman, Donald
C. (1983):, A Proto-Industrialization. A Concept Too Many. In: The Economic History

Historical Society, Sixth Series, 5, pp. 221–250. It is also recommended to take a look at

supposition of the automatic development of proto-industry into modern
industry the character of general validity.21 Despite all of the scepticism the
concept of proto-industrialisation still counts as a very useful analytical tool
for the interpretation of the gradual restructuring of the economy in the three
centuries from the 16th to the end of the 18th century, which the concept of
proto-industrialisation encompasses in its temporal dimension. The essential
contribution of the proto-industrialisation concept to the economic-historical
science is that this concept transcended the interpretative simplifications of
the economic development in view of the discontinuity of industrialisation in
the 19th century.22 With the presumption of proto-industrialisation processes
industrialisation finally lost its revolutionary character and became a part of the
gradualist interpretative pattern in the historical studies.
Thus Sidney Pollard (like many others before and after him) defined
industrialisation as a long-term set of various social, economic, technological
and organisational-administrative changes, and by no means as a sharp and
swift transition from one economic paradigm to another. At this point we
have to emphasise that despite industrialisation traditional social sectors
were preserved as well (craft industry, peasant craft production as well as
small agricultural lands) simultaneously with the modern industrial factory
compounds, mines, means of transport, capitalist agricultural facilities, etc.23
Traditional sectors may have operated in the context of market rules, but they
did not fit into the capitalist economy completely.24 They remained at the
21 See, for example, a very illustrative discussion Hudson, Pat, Proto-Industrialization in
England, In: Ogilvie (ed.), Cerman (ed.), European Proto-Industrialization, pp. 49–66,
referring to the work Colleman, A Proto-Industrialization, pp. 435–448, who, in his
criticism of the proto-industrialisation concept, emphasised the insufficient empirical
validity of the supposition with regard to the progression from proto-industrialisation to
industrialisation. 22 Walton, John (1987): Theory and Research on Industrialization. In: Annual Review of
Sociology, 13, pp. 89–108 (100). 23 Pollard, Sidney, The Industrial Revolution – an overview. In: Teich, Mikulaš, Porter, Roy
(1996): The Industrial Revolution in National Context. Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1996, pp. 371–387. 24 Economic historians tried to explain this kind of structural characteristics – when two
sectors co-exist (a relatively small, modern sector, depending on foreign demand; and
the dominant sector, based on domestic, local demand as well as on the self-sufficiency
of economy) – with the so-called »dualist theory«, which was not especially far-reaching.
They wanted to illustrate the conflicts in the economic environment, intensifying
the opposition between the capitalist part of the economy and the dominant forms of
pre-capitalist economy, and establish the general patterns of development. As we will find
out later, the Slovenian experience in the 19th century was not radically different from this.

brink of capitalist economy, if we refer to Braudel’s differentiation typology.25
Another contribution by Pollard is also noticeable in the conceptualisation of
industrialisation: because of the realisation that the process of industrialisation
differed in its structure and speed in the various regions of the national
economic spaces, he emphasised that the research activities should focus on the
regional aspects rather than on the national aspects when studying the origin
and development of industrialisation.26
The long-term changes in the structure and ways of the production of
goods outside of the agricultural branches can also be shown schematically. The
following table analyses the changes taking place in the non-agrarian production
in the time of the profound transition from the feudal economic structures to
the modern capitalist economy. The variables of the transformation are defined
from the viewpoint of the spatial and locational placement of non-agrarian
production, status of the participants in the production process (employees),
characteristics of the working cycle rhythm, supervisory and administrative
functions, ownership of the production factors, and, finally, the branch aspects.
On the basis of the foundations presented in Table 1. we can attempt to
define the basic developmental characteristics of the economic development in
the Slovenian territory in the time of the transition from feudalism to the capitalist economic system. In this regard we will sum up the thesis of Lojze Sočan
as an interpretative framework: that the achieved technological level determined the structure of production, commercial exchange, and thus also the position in the regional division of labour. We will carry out an overview on the
basis of certain variables with the potential to illustrate the characteristics of the
development during the transition from feudalism to capitalism and towards
the industrialisation in the modern times. While we undertake this we will not
pay any attention to the issues of the general environment (political situations,
economic policies, international circumstances, etc.), because we are limited in
terms of space. However, this environment is constantly present in the background of the ongoing changes that we present as characteristic features.

the Eastern European parts in the 19th century. 25 See the summary of his concepts: Braudel, Fernand 2010): Dinamika kapitalizma [The

up the basic conceptual outlines of the regional research approach, presented by Pollard
in much detail at the level of the concept and empirical substantiations in the book which
has acquired the status of the fundamental work addressing the issue of the European
industrialisation. See Pollard, Sidney (2002): Peaceful Conquest. The Industrialization of

With regard to the dynamics of changes in the Slovenian space the percentage of the peasant population is one of the most obvious indicators. Thus
Gestrin, for example, states that in the end of the 16th century almost 94 % of all
population of the Slovenian provinces lived in the rural areas.28 In view of this
information we can state that for the same percentage of the population agriculture was the exclusive or primary economic activity. If Gestrin's statement
is an estimate, the information dating back to 1910 is already far more reliable due to the well-developed statistical service. At that time around 67 % of
the population worked in agriculture.29 Realistic estimates for the time before

World War II (because the census was not carried out in 1941) place this share
at around 60 %.30
The information about the percentage of the peasant population is seen as
important by economic historians, without further substantiating this fact. It
attests to the levels of economic growth and gross domestic product, specifying
the relative position of an individual environment in the international/
inter-regional comparisons. Furthermore, this information also indicates very
slow endogenous economic dynamics in the Slovenian space throughout the
modern period. In three centuries the percentage of the peasant population in
the Slovenian territory decreased by merely one third. As a comparison let us
underline that in the countries representing the core of the Western Europe
the percentage of the peasant population dropped below one half of the total
population as early as in the first half of the 19th century. For example, in the
more developed parts of the Habsburg Monarchy the share of the peasant
population at the turn of the 19th century amounted to 30 %,31 which is even
lower than the percentage in Slovenia before World War II. In Europe in 1870 –
forty years before the Slovenian 67 % in 1910 – the following countries had the
following percentages of the population working in agriculture: Great Britain
14 %, Belgium 17 %, the Netherlands 35 %, France 59 %, and Austria 64 %, to
mention but a few.32 The differences are obvious and speak for themselves.
The comparatively low efficiency was another characteristic of agriculture.
Already in the 16th century agriculture had to face a challenge. It came across the
limitations of the production factors in view of the contemporaneous technology
(three-year rotation of crops, extensive grazing livestock production). The
pre-modern age, when the agricultural yield could be improved by extending
the arable areas, thus satisfying the increasing demand for food as a consequence
of the population growth, was coming to an end. With the end of the internal
colonisation the possibility for extensive production increase was exhausted.
Since the 18th century a gradual progress of agriculture began in accordance with
the technical agrarian measures, aimed to increase the labour productivity.
The problem of agrarian overpopulation is closely connected with the low
yield of the agricultural branches or the slowly increasing labour productivity.
This was characteristic for the Slovenian space until as late as World War II. To
put it simply, an imbalance existed between labour productivity in agriculture
and the number of population. This imbalance resulted in the fragmentation of

the land structure in agriculture. Fragmented agricultural lands are the most
characteristic example of economic lag. Because the economic growth was
slow, land was an indispensable production factor (survival factor!) under the
conditions where the population was increasing. Hence the constant pressure
to divide the land, in so far as the authorities did not intervene. Therefore this
involves an emphasis on the reallocation of the existing property and thus also
the long-term weakening of the economic potentials of agriculture as a whole.
The phenomenon started as early as in the 16th century, continued in the 18th
century,33 and was no less topical even as late as in the 19th century.34
Apart from the simultaneous principle of constancy or persistence of
phenomena, the long-term perspective of the modern age until World War II
also reveals two periods of notable discontinuity, when the re-agrarisation of the
Slovenian space took place. The diminishing importance of non-agrarian activities
in the economic structure is defined as re-agrarisation. Within the concept of
proto-industrialisation this phenomenon is defined as de-industrialisation.At
this point we can state that the development of the non-agrarian sector in the
Slovenian space was in close correlation with the scope of external demand and
other exogenous factors. Thus we claim that the significant fluctuations in the
direction of the developmental tendencies were a consequence of the changing
structure of external demand. As it is, through this relationship the basic
economic dilemma of the Slovenian space in its relation to the international
environment expresses itself. It has to do with the smallness of the economic
national space and the consequently low domestic demand (a consequence of
agrarian overpopulation!), which cannot fulfil the role of an exclusive driving
force of the economic development in the long term. When the domestic demand
was the dominant motive for economic development, the level of growth receded
(re-agrarisation/de-industrialisation). The slackening economic development
failed to accelerate the processes of economic de-feudalisation and transition
into the capitalist economy, and later also industrialisation. Therefore it is
not surprising that the fragmentation of economic subjects and lack of capital
available for economic activities, which hindered the economic initiative, scope
of business, defined the structure and lowered the international competitiveness
of the Slovenian economic subjects, were permanent characteristics. Only
companies able to develop a suitable economy of scope, especially thanks to the
foreign demand as well as the capital and professional reliance on the foreign
investors, could be competitive internationally.
Gestrin's research on the economic circumstances of the 16th century reveals
that the first point of discontinuity in the economic development (re-agrarisation,
de-industrialisation) can be identified already at the end of that century.

Economic transition as continuity (on the transition from feudalism...) 75
Non-agricultural activities in the Slovenian space diminished as the European
economic centre moved towards the Atlantic shores and the importance of the
Italian space (Republic of Venice, which the trade flows were mostly oriented
towards), receded. This also happened because of the general crisis resulting from
the economic situation as well as due to the political and military changes. As
it was, the Italian economic space or the demand there was the driving force of
the service and proto-industrial activities in Slovenia. The scope of agricultural
craft production as well as trade flows from and towards the Slovenian territory
receded, and gradually the few operational manufactures stopped functioning as
well. This was also related to the diminishing value of the bourgeois assets, which
by no means contributed to the strengthening of the capital basis of the economy.
Moreover, Gestrin reports that due to their strong capital foundations the Venetian
merchants gradually pushed out the merchants in the Slovenian territory from
the intermediation in the profitable trade in livestock from the Hungarian plains.
Not only that: the Italian entrepreneurs gradually took over the initiative in other
production activities as well, for example in the ironwork industry.
The stagnation and recession had direct consequences for further
development. The economic pressure incentives to ensure a swifter transition into
the capitalist economy were thus missing. The traditional feudal understanding
of the social division of labour remained untouchable. With the growth of the
non-agrarian sector the Slovenian space had to face a test of its capacity to
transform the feudal economic and social structures. This process was slow
as it was, especially in comparison with the European core and particularly in
the field of property rights and personal dependence of peasants. The external
manifestation of the changed circumstances was a significantly reduced number
of guild complaints against the peasant craft production and peasant trade,
which was also tolerated by the big landowners due to economic benefits.35
The role of craft guilds – the defenders of the feudal division of labour – in the
monopolisation of the existing domestic market and regulation of the otherwise
modest domestic demand (scarcity of urban population, self-sufficiency of
agricultural economy) was not yet seriously threatened.
The 18th century is deemed to be a period of intense changes with regard to
the feudal structures in the context of the mercantilist and physiocratic doctrine
and the state policies based on it. The centralised state undertook an active
state intervention in the economy. The new economic doctrines prioritised
the efficiency of economy due to the increasing level of knowledge and new
technologies. Precisely for this reason the measures to ensure the liberalisation
of economic activities (together with the simultaneously planned regulation)
were adopted at this time. Important measures included those in the field of
the regulation of economic activities of peasants (property rights, personal
dependence, regulation of duties), who expanded their operations to the field

76
of services (commerce, transport) and proto-industrial activities. The altered
approach and general economic boom resulted in the growth of production in the
Slovenian territory. This growth mostly stemmed from the rural areas, from the
ranks of peasants. The growth was notable because of the planned acceleration
of agricultural development and the renewed strengthening of agricultural craft
production. These relations are clearly evident from the evaluation of Jože Šorn,
who wrote, in his book on the beginnings of industry in the Slovenian territory,
that in the second half of the 18th century 29 % of the production was allegedly
contributed by the peasant craft production (otherwise unequally distributed
throughout the Slovenian space), 25 % by craft industry, 25 % by manufactures
and 21 % by mining and ironworks.36
Therefore economic emancipation of the peasants (indication of the final
de-feudalisation) already took place in the 18th-century proto-industrial period
and was strengthened by the expansion of the scope of the economic activities
in the rural regions in the context of agricultural and non-agricultural activities.
According to Šorn we can illustrate the importance of the peasant production
with the example of the production of canvas in Upper Carniola, which was
significant even in the Austrian context.37 Furthermore, Šorn’s conclusions
suggest that the production growth in Slovenia was a direct consequence of
the export demand. Šorn reconstructed the transportation routes through
Trieste and Rijeka or towards the northern parts of the Habsburg Monarchy
precisely.38 In Slovenia in the 18th century we are thus dealing with the classic
Pollard’s regionally diverse economic structure, where an exportation type of
proto-industrialisation was formed due to the production competitiveness.
Afterwards, in the 19th century, the second discontinuity in the economic
development – or the second “de-industrialisation” – of the modern times took
place. Due to the set of international circumstances (the Napoleonic Wars) and
the development of industrialisation in the North-Western Europe the external
demand changed once again, as the Slovenian economy became uncompetitive
in the international sense. Proto-industrial activities gradually lost their footing.
The competition of foreign industry was simply too stiff, at first in the foreign
markets and then in the domestic market as well. The process became even
swifter as the railway network was built. At that time the fundamental lag in the
economic development dynamics became evident. The railroad is an appropriate
example to illustrate the extent of the relative lag or the differences in the
starting positions on the threshold of industrialisation. In Great Britain the
railroad was a consequence of industrialisation, while in France and Germany it
36 Šorn, Začetki industrije na Slovenskem, pp. 62–63. 37 It is interesting that this activity was even mentioned in the overviews of the European
history as an example of a significant scale and economic importance for the local area as
well as for the wider region. See Di Vittorio, An Economic History of Europe, p. 119. 38 Šorn, Začetki industrije na Slovenskem, pp. 62–69.
Vol. 12, No 2, 2015: 61-88
Economic transition as continuity (on the transition from feudalism...) 77
was, for example, an integral part or the driving force of industrialisation. The
situation in the Eastern Europe, including Slovenia, was completely different.
There the railroad was barely a harbinger of industrialisation,39 connecting these
areas with the wider transportation and economic flows. Industrialisation itself,
however, did not begin until a few decades after the railways had been built. The
railroad was constructed with foreign capital and foreign knowledge (as well as
because of foreign strategic needs), and its influences on the existing economic
structure were by no means singularly positive. The railways exhibit the same
lag of approximately half a century between the construction of the first lines,
built to satisfy the strategic requirements of the Habsburg Monarchy, and the
network intended to address the local needs.40
With the loss of regional competitiveness the development model in
the Slovenian territory changed once again. With stagnation and gradual
disappearance of the proto-industrial production and service activities
(transportation) the process of re-agrarisation reoccurred. The process of the
second »de-industrialisation«, as the decline of the peasant craft production is
defined, was thus triggered. At least Carniola, as the central Slovenian province,
had a more evidently agrarian character in the second half of the 19th century
in comparison with the preceding period.41 With re-agrarisation the domestic
economic incentives for a swifter transition to the capitalist economic system
were missing once again, and the life span of what were otherwise already
dissolving feudal structures was extended even further. When the process of
de-feudalisation occurred also formally after 1848, this was a consequence of
an arbitrary political decision, dictated by the internal-political situation as
well as by the wish to ensure the economic modernisation of the Monarchy. At
this time industrialisation had already become imperative – quite the opposite
from the countries of the North-Western Europe, where de-feudalisation had

The process of »re-agrarisation« was not only a Slovenian peculiarity, nor is it unusual.
Researchers have also detected similar processes, taking place elsewhere in Europe.
As individual areas started entering the European economic space more intensively
and the industrialisation began, the importance of agrarian activities in the economic
structure often became stronger once again. In a way this was an adaptation to the new
circumstances, as the non-agrarian sector was inefficient and thus uncompetitive in
comparison with the industrial production, while the international agricultural product
market was open. For more information about these processes see Turnnock, David, The
Economy of East Central Europe. London: Reutledge, 2006; BEREND, History Derailed.

concluded organically as long as several decades earlier.42 For the Slovenian
territory the process of de-feudalisation implied that the capitalist economic
and social institutions would be imported. It was a transition which involved
a political process from the top, from outside, and did not encompass many
changes resulting from the endogenous economic dynamics. The new imported
institutional framework had to be filled with domestic contents. The Slovenian
manifestation of capitalism had to be defined. Thus a process of the adoption
and adaptation of institutions and innovations of the capitalist economy to the
Slovenian environment, lasting for several decades, was initiated.
With re-agrarisation domestic demand became the driving force of the economic
growth. Due to the structural crisis of agriculture the Slovenian space was caught
in the vicious circle of poverty, low income, meagre savings, modest investments
and deficient technological level. Agrarian overpopulation and redistribution of
the existing social wealth in the form of the fragmentation of agricultural property
once again became topical. The re-agrarisation of the Slovenian space corresponds
to the thesis that no direct connection necessarily exists between the developed
proto-industrial activities and industrialisation. In such cases industrialisation had
to begin completely anew. Re-agrarisation also attests to the level of entrepreneurship,
which failed to perform its much-needed role as an agent of economic changes at
this time.43 For the second half of the 19th century a dualist economic structure
was characteristic for the Slovenian space and two economic sectors co-existed:
the majority traditional (peasant and craft) sector and the capitalist sector. The
former, traditional sector depended on domestic demand. As this demand was
modest due to the vicious circle of poverty, the economic growth was modest as
well. Until the 1880s or 1890s the traditional sector operated mostly on the verge of
the capitalist system.44 Due to the expansion of the capitalist economy in the wider
environment, the traditional sectors were constantly threatened. Thus the protective
rhetoric strengthened again, just like at the end of the 16th century. Both periods
share the efforts for the »protection of domestic labour« (Valentin Suppan) and
for the interventionist delimitation between the traditional sectors and capitalist

industrialisation as well as its territorial dynamics in the Western Europe see Damsgaard,
Hansen (2001): European Economic History. From Mercantilism to Maastricht and Beyond.
Copenhagen: Copenhagen Business School Press. 43 In the economic history much attention has been paid to entrepreneurship as the driving
force of the accelerated economic growth and economic innovation, also when explaining
the dynamics of industrialisation. Entrepreneurship and its importance was introduced
into the science of economy by Joseph Schumpeter, and later this aspect has also asserted
itself in the economic historiography. See More, Charles (2000): Understanding the
Industrial Revolution. London: Routlege, 2000, pp. 19–23. 44 Of the newer overviews of the economic history in the second half of the 19th century in

economy.45 In the 19th century the environment structured in this manner was also
unable to defend itself from the anti-capitalist rhetoric or ideology.
The domestic capitalist sector represented little threat to domestic
agriculture or craft industry – after all, it was modest and completely dependent
on the export demand. Ever since the beginning it had been established with the
foreign markets in mind and was thus internationally competitive and based
on modern technology. Three sectors were most prominent: textile industry46,
ironwork industry47, and coal industry.48 The capitalist sector was encouraged
by foreigners, and it was based on foreign initiative, capital and knowledge. Due
to its meagre scope (around ten companies) the capitalist sector was unable to
change the general development model and influence the type of the Slovenian
industrialisation in the 19th century. It was incapable of encouraging the export
type of industrialisation. None of the economic sectors in the Slovenian space
asserted themselves as the leading industry, if we use Rostow's term from his
stages of economic growth.49 Simply put, in the Slovenian space no branch of
industry had a strong enough development dynamic to encourage the growth
of the wider economic and regional environment. Therefore no economic
sectors or branches of industry existed capable of securing the path which the
exportation capitalist sector (industrial or agricultural) ensured in Scandinavia,
for example.50

The Slovenian economic development in the 19th century was therefore
based on domestic demand and consequently very slow due to the structural
characteristics of the dominant part of the economy (percentage of peasant
population, purchase power). Without the modernisation of agriculture – that is,
increased productivity and income growth of the peasant population – swifter
industrialisation could not take place.51 Faster economic growth cannot occur
until the population keeps investing the majority of its labour into securing its
basic existence. The situation in agriculture stabilised in the 1880s and 1890s.52
With the strengthening of the purchase power the domestic demand started
more actively encouraging the transition of the traditional economic sectors into
the capitalist forms of production, especially in the fields with low technological
complexity.53 The domination of the capitalist economy in the Slovenian space
occurred in the Yugoslav context after 1918. Just like before, in the 16th and 18th
century the driving force of the economic growth and scope of the capitalist
sector was foreign demand, this time in the form of the Yugoslav market and
protectionist economic policy.54 Textile industry expanded most evidently. In the
comparative sense this means that the type of industrialisation in the interwar
period was still based on the technologically less demanding level. Thus Slovenia
took the final step towards the industrial character of economy when the lands in
the core of Europe had already been in the process of technological transformation
involving the introduction of modern scientific achievements into industrial
production processes for almost five decades.55 In the period between the two
world wars Slovenian industrialisation can thus be defined with the parameters
of the 19th century, when the investments in the physical capital were essential for
the encouragement of economic growth and technological transformation.
51 See Novak, Zamudniški vzorci industrializacije. 52 The results of the cumulative slowness with regard to the growth of the productivity in
agriculture, reduction of the level of agrarian overpopulation (emigration!), growth of
savings (credit cooperatives) and growth of purchase power despite the same level of income
due to the system of cooperatives became apparent. For more information see Lazarević,

Economic transition as continuity (on the transition from feudalism...) 81
In conclusion of this discussion we can state a few final inferences or theses,
summing up the characteristics of the economic transition from feudalism to
capitalism in Slovenia in the modern period:
1) Slovenian space was permanently on the verge of the European processes
of transformation of the feudal economic system into a capitalist economy.
2) External demand was the driving force of structural economic changes,
as domestic demand could not carry out its role as the agent of the economic restructuring due to the low level of income. The dependence on
domestic demand lengthened the process of changes in economy considerably and preserved or expanded the dimensions of the lag.
3) Slovenian economy and society entered these processes with a lag of
several decades and with significant discontinuities manifesting themselves as re-agrarisation or de-industrialisation in the proto-industrial
interpretative concept.
4) In the time of the discontinuity re-agrarisation the reallocation of the
existing property took place, manifesting itself as the fragmentation of
agricultural property. The fragmented agricultural property expressed
itself as the most characteristic example of the relative economic backwardness.
5) Foreign entrepreneurs were the decisive proponents of change, introducing capital, market, business and administrative knowledge as well
as technologies in the Slovenian space.
6) The smallness of the economic national space was a restrictive factor.
It resulted in the fragmented structure and lack of capital available for
economic activities. This, in turn, stifled the economic initiative, hindering the capital adequacy and international competitiveness of Slovenian economic subjects.
7) Only companies able to develop a suitable scope of economy due to foreign (export) demand were able to adopt the capitalist operating principles. For this purpose they required capital and knowledge, which was
provided by foreign entrepreneurs. Until as late as World War II the role
of foreign capital and foreign entrepreneurs remained of key importance
for the development of capitalist economy.
8) The fundamental dilemma of the Slovenian space and economic development reveals itself in the field of technological progress or more
sophisticated business-operational structures. The relatively early or
simultaneous modernisation beginnings of the transition to the new
production technologies and business process organisations (or »islands
of modernisation«, as Sidney Pollard defines them) were not followed
by a mass process. For a long time the first efforts remained isolated
attempts, foreign elements in what was traditionally a dominantly agrarian economic environment at the level of technology as well as economic

and social institutions. These first modernist phenomena remained
exotic for so long that in the meantime their stimulating power to
encourage structural changes and new institutional forms of economic
life was completely exhausted.</p>
